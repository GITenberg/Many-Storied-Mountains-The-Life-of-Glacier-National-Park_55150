<p class="pcap">The landform of Glacier National Park is a monument
to the power of moving ice. This view from Stoney
Indian Pass  is startlingly different
from the scene of a million years ago, when the glaciers
of the Pleistocene were sculpturing the land. Only the
higher peaks would then have been visible above the
blanket of ice that flowed like a slow-moving river
down into the Mokowanis Valley and out into the
Great Plains beyond.</p>

<h3>About This Book</h3>
<p>This natural history of the mountain
wilderness called Glacier National Park
is not a guidebook, but provides an overview
of the ecology of the region. At the
same time, it is a personal statement,
revealing one individual&rsquo;s response to this
rugged, delicate land.</p>
<p>For their consistent cooperation and
helpfulness, I wish especially to thank
Chief Naturalist Ed Rothfuss and his
capable staff. Technical and field assistance
came from many; for special
thanks, I would like to single out Art
Sedlack, Francis Singer, Bert Gildart,
Walt Martin, Craig Kuchel, and Danny
On. The manuscript profited greatly from
the criticism of Douglas Chadwick, to
whom I am deeply grateful.</p>

financial support given this book project

Plains. Wedges of geese, high and determined,
began this storm of spring, their
voices sharp as the morning frost. Sicklebills
cry to claim the land, sandhill cranes wheel
and talk overhead, and everywhere the killdeer
shout. Pasqueflowers push the bleak
soil aside, beginning the westward rush that
I must join, seeking again the sight of
mountains.</p>
<p>In Glacier National Park the land is
folded up. On the east, Chief Mountain, Curly
Bear, and Rising Wolf break the prairie&rsquo;s
hold. When the early French fur trappers
saw these peaks glistening in the distance
with summer-long snows and perpetual ice,
they named this region &ldquo;the land of shining
mountains.&rdquo; But for all the ice and snow
that reflect the summer sun, the park&rsquo;s present
glaciers are but snowflakes compared to
the mighty rivers of ice that carved this
land. Glaciation, the magnificent sculptor,
left its bold signature everywhere, and this
park honors with its name the force that
shaped it.</p>
<p>But the essential excitement of this land
is more than cliff face, spire, and sudden
storm. It comes to you when you realize
that here is an aggregation of dramatically
differing life zones, where a day&rsquo;s walk can
easily take you from prairie and forest to
treelimit and tundra; where a dense forest
of redcedar and hemlock, similar to the rain
forests of the Pacific coast, exists a score of
kilometers from the great prairie sea.</p>
<p>Or it comes when you discover that
these mountains&mdash;young and sharp with
shadows, snow-jeweled and newly gowned
with forests&mdash;are chiseled from the oldest
unaltered sedimentary rocks on earth.</p>
<p>I come from the prairie and love its
broad strokes; I&rsquo;ve learned to hear the singing
in the grass and to see those long, slow
seasons soar the level horizons like gliding
hawks. But here I learned to match my days
against a wild earth, and in me grew the
mysterious need to know a mountain from
its every side. Mountains that wear the dawn
like yellow hats, repeated in the named and
nameless lakes. Mountains that stretch the
storms between them and balance rainbows
ridge to ridge.</p>
<p>I must see again the secret forest places,
where the paleflowered wood-nymphs hover
like a breath, and know once more the endless
meadows painted camas blue.</p>
<p>I need the perfect freedom of this land,
to be able to say, <i>today I will climb Siyeh</i>:
to stand, for a time, on the rugged shoulders
of this upright earth.</p>

<h3 id="c3">Bedrock: The First Story</h3>
<p>On the trail that connects the Logan Pass
visitor center to Hidden Lake overlook
there is a shallow pond. Near Hidden Pass,
it collects its meltwater from the Continental
Divide and sends it down the shallow gorge
that drains the Hanging Gardens; as a
waterfall it plunges into the upper St. Mary
Valley where it becomes Reynolds Creek;
joined by other tributaries, it continues its
long journey to Hudson Bay.</p>
<p>The surface of this pond is seldom still,
for the wind treats it like a sea. Because the
water is shallow, the wave action wrinkles
the bottom mud into ripple patterns, mimicking
the churning waves.</p>
<p>I like to come here early in the morning.
Sometimes, arriving before the wind awakes,
I catch reflections of the surrounding mountains.
Beyond the low bench of Logan Pass
the Garden Wall begins, running northward
with the Divide. In the eastern valley the
pitched peak of Going-to-the-Sun hunkers in
the morning light like a tensed warrior. To
the south, the incisor Bearhat, beautiful
cloud cutter of Hidden Lake Valley, juts
above the nearby saddle of the pass. But
over this place, standing as fresh monuments
to an age of ice, tower the cliffs of Clements
and the pyramid Reynolds.</p>
<p>I am sitting on a wedge of red rock.
Its surface exhibits a wrinkled pattern identical
to the ripples in the soft mud of the
shallow pond. The distance is not great;
with a stick I could reach out and touch the
mud. Yet this represents a gulf no bird can
fly, for between the ripples of this rock and
the ripples of this mud lie billions of vanished
mornings, a constellation of years.</p>
<p>These red, green, tan, white, black and
purple bands of rock that layer Glacier&rsquo;s
mountains comprise the oldest unaltered
sedimentary rocks on Earth. They were laid
down in Precambrian time, more than a
billion years ago, when life was just beginning,
as the deposits of an inland sea.</p>
<p>For millions of years, sand, mud and
carbonates washed into the ancient sea,
compressing the lower layers into mudstones
and limestones, building up a sediment
thickness that may have been as much as
10,000 meters (<i>see</i> metric conversion table
on <a href="#Page_136">page 136</a>).</p>
<p>When we look at the sharp contours of
Glacier&rsquo;s mountains, we see the evidence of
uplift, overthrust and glaciation. But on the
geologic clock these are recent events, a
mere eyeblink of time ago. For the vast
majority of years, the rocks lay undisturbed
and level beneath the sea and land.</p>
<p>To understand better the tremendous
time scale these rocks represent, we need a
way to visualize the vast collection of years.
If we were to make a movie of these geologic
events, we would first need to determine
how many years each minute should
represent. Since the Pleistocene lasted about
3,000,000 years (its four ice ages sculpting
the present muscle of this land), let us make
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
each minute portray a million years. To
chronicle these rocks we will then need a
film 60 hours long!</p>
<p>Not until the fifty-seventh hour of our
film will the Mesozoic lowlands begin to
bulge with the coming Rocky Mountain
chain. During the long preceding hours we
would have seen little else but sea&mdash;withdrawing,
advancing, deep and shallow; yellow,
green, and brown with great colonies
of algae. Unseen below the water, lava has
spilled out occasionally on the sea bottom;
once, it intruded between the rock layers
below, forming the conspicuous, 60-meter-thick
band of black diorite that we see today
on many mountain faces in Glacier.</p>
<p>During this time of initial uplift an
amazing process is going on deep underground.
A major fault has developed,
fracturing the buckled layers of rock. A
vast mountain plate begins to slide eastward,
over-riding and submerging the rock layers
to the east and opening the wide trench
that is today the North Fork Valley. Known
as the Lewis Overthrust, this gigantic earth-force
has created an unusual situation: ancient
rock strata lying atop recent rock
strata.</p>
<p>Now less than 3 minutes of film remain.
The arrival of the ice is imminent. We look
at the landscape of featureless mountains and
wonder at the dramatic difference that this
last 3 million years will make. We do not
see the familiar forests and lakes, the
savage peaks, and the broad, deep valleys
of this present land. These mountains are
gentle, arid, and shallow-valleyed. The
vague outlines are there; we recognize the
general alignments of the drainage systems,
the bloated domes from which sharp peaks
will be cut. The mountains are connected
to one another by blunt ridges and smooth
saddles, and the shadows they cast are dull,
dunelike.</p>
<p>Suddenly the ice is there, filling the
landscape, with only the mountaintops protruding.
Four times in these last 3 minutes
of film the ice sheets advance and retreat,
each time leaving an altered landscape.
Strange lakes and forests fill the gaps between
the glacial invasions. Then we
see the mountains we now know come into
being rapidly, as if the land were being
hacked into shape by giant cleavers.</p>
<p>After this flicker of Pleistocene time,
the film ends, the forests return, and familiar
lakes shine beneath the sun again&mdash;these
lakes and forests we had thought to
be timeless.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />Up springs the morning wind from Hidden
Valley, making the nearby alpine fir branches
whiz with its passing and shattering the perfect
reflection of Bearhat Peak on the pond.
From where I sit, it is a short distance to
Hidden Pass; so I leave the pond and walk
to the overlook to see again the fine basin
quarried by an ancient glacier.</p>
<p>Hidden Lake, deep, far below, so blue,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
fits into its cliffed, crooked valley like a
polished boomerang. Closely ringed by
ridge and peak&mdash;distant Sperry Glacier and
pointed Gunsight peering up from the
southern jumble, and broad Bearhat impossibly
close&mdash;this lovely lake is almost lost
amid such sharp proclamations of rock. Its
outlet gorge gives a narrow view across the
angled, hidden valleys of Avalanche and
McDonald, past the pyramid of Stanton, to
the low, faraway undulations of the Whitefish
Range.</p>
<p>Glaciation is a cruel master of mountains,
biting deeply into their bulk and leaving
sheer, spectacular contours when the
glaciers disappear. The landforms here attest
to their power, everywhere exhibiting
the effects of glaciation.</p>
<p>In eating back the mountain headwall,
alpine glaciers formed rounded depressions,
called cirques. Unlike the narrow
clefts left by running water, these broad,
deep basins look as though they were made
by ice-cream scoops gouging into the rock.
Hidden, Ptarmigan, Iceberg, and Avalanche
Lakes sit in well-developed cirque basins,
and many mountains are dimpled by the
beginnings of other cirques&mdash;the conspicuous
amphitheater on the south shoulder of
Heaven&rsquo;s Peak, for example.</p>
<p>Occupying all major drainage systems,
glaciers modified the contour of the valleys,
changing them from their narrow, stream-cut
V-shapes into broad U-shapes. Into
these wide main valleys, waterfalls plunge
from higher, smaller valleys. Like rivers,
flowing glaciers have tributaries. Lacking
the ice mass and cutting power of the main
glaciers, these tributary ice fingers could not
bite as deeply into the bedrock. When the
ice melted, hanging valleys were left
stranded high above the main valley floor.
Hidden Lake sits in one of these hanging
valleys, and from it Hidden Creek plunges
750 meters into Avalanche Basin toward
McDonald Creek.</p>
<p>On my many previous visits to this pass
I have been too busy enjoying the wildflowers,
the weather, or the scenery to realize
what an open textbook of glaciation is
everywhere displayed.</p>
<p>I stand here on a small saddle of a pass.
Wherever glaciers met, passes, or cols,
were created. A high, notched pass like this
one (or Swiftcurrent or Gunsight) reveals
recent connections. Broad, lower passes,
such as Logan, resulted where the ice early
overran the mountain ridge and had a
chance to work longer.</p>
<p>Where two glaciers worked on opposing
sides of a ridge and failed to meet, they
formed an ar&ecirc;te&mdash;a thin, steep-walled remnant
resembling a saw blade. Another ice
age would probably consume the park&rsquo;s
many thin ar&ecirc;tes, such as the Garden Wall
and Ptarmigan Wall; but it would also
create new ones from existing ridges.</p>
<p>Further testimony to the sculpting
power of ice is presented by Mt. Reynolds,
looming to the east. The most dramatic
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
feature of a glaciated landscape is the
pyramid-shaped mountain called a horn&mdash;and
Reynolds is a perfect example. Horns
were formed when three or more glaciers
cloaked the mountain, excavating its sides
toward its core and gradually transforming
its original domed shape into a sheer-sided
peak. Glacier has many remarkable horns,
from the sleek spire of St. Nicholas in the
south to exquisite Kinnerly in the northern
Kintla valley.</p>
<p>Sperry Glacier stares back at me from
the flank of Gunsight. Glaciers found in
the park today are not remnants of the
last ice phase, which ended here about
8,000 years ago, but are newly formed,
having come into existence some 4,000
years ago. They reflect a cooling trend in
the present climate.</p>
<p>Shrinking steadily from their period of
greatest extent in the middle of the last
century, these modern glaciers finally stabilized
in the late 1940s and since then have
shown only a slight increase in area.</p>
<p>Movement distinguishes glaciers from
icefields, and the movement of ice is a force
on as well as a feature of a landscape. A
glacier excavates by abrading and plucking
at the rock. Alternately melting and freezing,
ice at the headwalls plucks out blocks of
rock. Ultimately the rocks are deposited
along the sides or at the feet of the glacier
as moraine debris. But as they move in the
grip of the ice, they constantly abrade the
rock surfaces they encounter. Polished rock
beds of past glaciers show striations&mdash;grooves
gouged by rock fragments imbedded
in the moving ice.</p>
<p>Flow rate of a glacier depends upon
the thickness of the ice and the degree of
slope. Under tremendous pressure, ice becomes
plastic, like thick taffy. Unlike kilometer-thick
continental glaciers, which may
move a hundred meters a day, small alpine
glaciers seldom progress more than two or
three centimeters per day.</p>
<p>Although a glacier moves, it gets nowhere
if in a state of equilibrium&mdash;when
annual melting equals annual accumulation.
Snow mass gained at the sun-shielded headwall
is usually lost as melt at the exposed
snout. Glaciers such as Sexton or Weasel
Collar, whose snouts perch on cliff edges,
also lose mass by calving. Thunder you hear
on a late-summer day near such a glacier
may actually be the sound of ice pushed off
from the lip of a cliff.</p>
<p>Walking back to the visitor center, I
suddenly stop where the trail skirts the steep
moraine of Mt. Clements. From the opposite
side of the moraine five mountain goats have
appeared. Spotting me on the trail below,
they also halt. But before I can get to my
camera they are off in a stiff-legged gallop,
running in single file along the crest of the
moraine to the distant safety of the mountain
face.</p>
<p>Moraines are ridges of rock debris piled
up along the edges and terminuses of glaciers.
Like a bracelet lying against the wall
of this mountain, the circle of steeply piled
debris marks the extent of a small, recently
vanished glacier. Ghost of the power that
once resided here, a stagnant icefield lies
beneath the confining walls of the moraine.
The recent accumulation of these rock fragments
is a mighty accomplishment, attesting
to the force of moving ice.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>A Divided Climate</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">Because of an eastward flow of cool,
moist Pacific air masses, the climate of
northwestern Montana, including the
western portion of Glacier National Park,
differs from that of other portions of
Montana. As a result of increased precipitation,
Glacier&rsquo;s western valleys support
a rich flora, more typical of the Pacific
Northwest.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>West</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">Moist Pacific air</p>
<p class="pcapc">As the moisture-laden Pacific winds are pushed up the
windward slopes of Glacier&rsquo;s mountains, the air cools
and water vapor condenses, forming fog or clouds.
Rain or snow begins to fall as the air continues to rise
and cool. By the time the air mass reaches the crest and
flows down the leeward slopes, most of the moisture
has been lost.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Western slopes average about 70 cm. of precipitation at
elevations between 900 and 1,100 m. Upper elevations
average 200 to 250 cm., mostly in the form of snow; and
300 to 500 cm. is common.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>East</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">Dry chinook winds</p>
<p class="pcapc">Eastern slopes, under the influence of Continental air
masses, receive less annual precipitation. West Glacier&rsquo;s
annual average is 66.5 cm. Babb, a small town east of the
park, averages 49.3 cm. Frequent high winds east of the
Divide further reduce moisture through evaporation.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Exposed to Arctic air masses flowing down from Canada,
locations east of the Divide also suffer more severe
winter conditions than do protected western valleys.
Average January temperature is -5&deg;C at West Glacier,
-8&deg; at Babb.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Moreover, 80 percent of the winter days in the western
portion of the park are overcast, a condition almost
identical to that of Seattle, Wash. This serves to moderate
winter temperatures and to minimize evaporation.</p>

chipmunks adapt easily to the presence of people and
become nuisances if encouraged by handouts. Feeding
rodents is dangerous and is harmful to them. By altering
their diets and blunting their cautious instincts,

this, metabolic rates must be high; food is rapidly
processed and used up. Thus, since fat reserves are
not practical on such small animals, they must eat at
frequent intervals.</p>

<p>Reaching the mountain wall, the goats
scramble upward to a ledge, sending scree
streams pouring from several clefts. Encountering
a narrow, steep snowbank, they
do not hesitate but continue across the
slope. Above the rock fingers of this peak
the gathering clouds grow black. A sudden
crack of thunder hurries me down the trail.</p>
<p>Although geologically young, the Rocky
Mountains in Glacier are composed of soft
sedimentary rocks that are easily assailed by
the many agents of weathering and erosion.
If not rejuvenated by continual uplift, these
magnificent peaks will glimmer but briefly
in the long memory of the planet.</p>
<p>Already the sharp countenance of this
land is being softened by the ongoing forces
of erosion. Chief among these is water,
which attacks the mountains everywhere.
In addition, frost action continually exploits
rock fractures, breaking down blocks of rock
into talus and scree. Avalanche and rockfall
sweep down the slopes. Layers of softer rock
erode quickly, undercutting more resistant
rock and creating overhangs which gravity,
in time, will collapse.</p>
<p>The lashing rain catches me on this
sun-and-storm-contested pass. Ice, gravity,
wind, and especially water&mdash;all attack a land
that dares the clouds.</p>

<h3 id="c4">The Rising of the Sun and the Running of the Deer: A Glacier Year</h3>
<p>As if to make up for the days-long darkness
of this last blizzard, the peaks today wear
snow plumes&mdash;long, graceful trails of white,
curving up into an ice-blue sky. Yesterday
the snow-mad wind raced through the forest.
Today the motionless trees are cloaked in
heavy, glistening robes, the leafless aspen
and young larch bent down.</p>
<p>Moderate snowfall helps many plants
and animals survive the winter. For ground
dwellers it provides insulation from the
wildly fluctuating winter temperatures encountered
east of the Divide, protecting the
hibernators and providing cover for the
many small mammals that remain active
during the winter. Wind-swept ground
freezes deep; but under a mantle of snow
life-sustaining heat is trapped, permitting
many animals to survive and allowing the
work of decomposers to continue.</p>
<p>But this has been a winter of too much
snow and too many temperature extremes.
The heavy snowpack has forced the sharp-hoofed
deer to yard up in great numbers;
unable to range freely in deep snow, they
are forced into smaller and smaller confines
where their numbers allow them to break
and maintain trails. But in time they exhaust
the food supply. Younger deer, unable
to reach the increasingly higher browse line,
starve first. Then the does, heavy with unborn
fawns, grow weak and fall to predators.
So the imprisoned herds dwindle quickly
this year, sometimes less than a kilometer
from plentiful browse.</p>
<p>Deep snow is also death for many seed-eating
birds. As they are unable to scratch
for food, their body furnaces quickly fail,
and during a night of cold wind their fluffed
corpses drop into the snow.</p>
<p>Exposed to the noon sun, the snow surface
thaws; when refrozen, it is restructured
to crystalline ice. If snow repeatedly thaws
and freezes, an ice barrier is formed, shutting
off vital air exchange. Plants are then
subject to rot, and micro-animal life is
smothered. Travel beneath the snow is made
more difficult for mice and shrews and they
are deprived of food and cover. Under such
conditions their numbers rapidly decline.</p>
<p>But while many starve in a winter of
deep snow, others benefit. The exposed
traffic of small mammals is to the owl&rsquo;s
advantage. Foxes and coyotes more easily
run down rabbits and hares on crusted snow.
Deer and, to a lesser extent, wapiti and
moose&mdash;their hoofs punching through the
snowpack&mdash;swiftly tire in deep snow and
become helpless before cougar or wolf,
whose lighter weight is supported by the
crust.</p>
<p>Grim as this winter&rsquo;s toll becomes,
enough will survive to begin the process of
renewal in spring. Last winter, a season of
light snow, was a time of hardship for predators.
The deer remained strong, the wapiti
remote on high, windswept ridges, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
small mammals hidden.</p>
<p>Only the water ouzel, winter after winter,
seems not to notice the hardships of the
season. Lord of his small world of open
water, he sings in February, wading and
swimming his diminished stream to find a
never-failing supply of water insects and
small fish. It is a voice of spring&mdash;glad, wild,
continual as the moving water&mdash;an incongruous
song in this winter-shrouded land.</p>
<p>But with the growing stature of the
sun, the grip of winter softens. The firs and
spruce send their loads of snow sliding to
the ground. Streams begin to sing again and
soon the lakes increase, the booming of
splitting ice breaking the silence of the valleys.
Avalanches thunder down the steeper
slopes, carrying trees to the swollen streams.
Rivers hiss and rage, speeding the debris
along. A spring that comes too suddenly will
bring flood to lower elevations.</p>
<p>Snow geese thread through the valleys,
and ground squirrels tunnel up through snow
to find invasions of birds returning from the
south. Soon the three-petaled wakerobins
appear, chasing the snowline up the ridges.
Glacier lilies and Calypso orchids are next,
and with the shooting stars spring arrives.</p>
<p>The melting snow releases a new group
of animals to populate the winter-thinned
land. Up come chipmunks. Bears reappear.
Young red squirrels, helpless and blind,
squirm in their nest holes. Hidden dens
rustle with pups and kits. Soon warm days
will bring them out and the business of
learning to cope with their world will begin.</p>
<p>All life responds irresistibly to the
growing strength of the Sun. Cottonwood,
willow, and maple come into flower and
unfold new leaves; green needle clusters
spot the limbs of larches that in winter
had seemed lifeless snags among the other
conifers. Beneath the soil of prairie,
meadow, and forest, in the mud of lakes and
ponds, other life stirs; armies of insects,
spiders, crustaceans, amphibians, and fish
will strive to complete their life cycles
against the formidable odds of a predatory
world.</p>
<p>Spring reaches higher up the mountains,
the lowlands passing into summer. Wapiti
and mountain sheep follow the rising tide
of succulent browse up to the high meadows.
In forest, grove, and meadow and along the
stream new fledglings appear&mdash;thrush, vireo,
hummingbird, waxwing, harlequin duck,
bluebird, osprey, and flicker&mdash;as holes, nests,
and cavities brim with begging mouths.</p>
<p>In the alpine meadows, where snow
overlaps the spring and winter follows hard
behind the summer, the growing season is
short and the climate unstable. Sensing the
stronger light, flowers push up impatiently
through the snow and hasten into bloom.
Pikas and marmots scurry and sunbathe
among the rocks of scree slopes.</p>
<p>Summer matures in ripening huckleberries,
and the bears that grazed the spring
grasses now gorge themselves fat. Dry days
of August bring probing lightning, threatening
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
the forests with fire.</p>
<p>Sweeps of beargrass reach their climax
now in the highest meadows. In dizzy succession
wildflowers set seed. Fat and sluggish,
marmots and ground squirrels disappear beneath
the rocks. The golden eagle must
search longer each day to find prey within
its vast domain.</p>
<p>Autumn lingers in the valleys and on
the flanks of low ridges. The morning sun
glints on hoarfrost, firing the yellow leaves
of larch, aspen, birch, maple, and cottonwood,
and shines on the blood-red berries
of mountain-ash. Soon a night of killing
frost will bring down the corpses of insects
and spiders by the millions. The reptiles and
amphibians, being cold-blooded animals,
seem out of place in this long-wintered land.
Unable to maintain body temperatures appreciably
above their surroundings, they are
the first to seek the protection of hibernation,
collecting in dens or burying themselves
beneath the ooze of pond bottoms.</p>
<p>Songbirds gather and leave the valleys.
The harsh cries of jays sound ominous now
in the forest. Only the chickadees seem to
ignore the long tree shadows; their ceaseless
conversations carry through the leafless
underbrush as they busily search for seed.</p>
<p>Velvet has gone to bone, and in these
final noon-warm days the rut runs through
the land. It begins in the valleys in September
with the joustings of deer and moose
and the buglings of bull wapiti puncturing
the forest silence. By November the higher
meadows ring with the collisions of bighorn
rams who compete for ewes by smashing
together their massive, curled horns. On
high slopes mountain goat billies posture and
swagger; head to tail, they circle, threatening
each other with dagger-like horns.</p>
<p>From Flathead Lake, 100 stream kilometers
to the south, kokanee salmon return to
spawn in the clear, cold shallows of McDonald
Creek. Gathering bald eagles surround
the stream, again and again lifting
vulnerable fish from pool and riffle. Perched
by the hundreds along the stream course,
their white heads and tails glistening against
the dark trees, they stand out like lanterns
strung for a banquet.</p>
<p>Now the stinging wind comes down
from the peaks and shuts the lakes. Life
slows or sleeps. Ptarmigan, snowshoe hare,
and longtail weasel, all wearing winter white,
seek shelter and food in a silent land where
spring and yellow lilies seem forever lost.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />All life faces one ultimate challenge: to survive
or not, to reproduce or fail, to bring
one&rsquo;s kind to tomorrow&rsquo;s sun or vanish forever.
This land is harsh. To survive in nature
demands skill in the individual, excellence
in the species, and a chance from the
environment.</p>

<h3 id="c6">Over Going-to-the-Sun Road</h3>
<p>I like to begin with St. Mary, a lake the
whitecaps love to run. From the far passes
the several winds gather and collect, arranging
long lines of white waves for the race
downlake. Past the purple scree of Mahtotopa
and Little Chief they go, white as the
headdress of Going-to-the-Sun Mountain,
colliding, collapsing along the promontory
snares about the Narrows. Onward they
press, spreading out and setting sail for the
straight rush to the final shore where a line
of cottonwoods sings with a sound like
applause.</p>
<p>Across the lake the timbered ridge
starkly contrasts the finger of prairie that
claims the north shore. This is a flower-glad
place, a meeting-ground for mountain and
prairie plants. Along the road the grassland
holds the conifers back, allowing only
scattered clumps of aspens.</p>
<p>Finally, at Rising Sun, beneath the
shadow of Goat Mountain, the prairie ends
and wind-seasoned Douglas-firs announce
the coming forest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s excitement now, with the prairie
heat gone, the wind scent raw with fir and
high meadows, honed by waterfall and tall,
dank rock. Our mountain thirst is never
extinguished, and a road that tightens down
to cliff face and sudden turn brings back
to our blood the ancient need to go to the
highest place.</p>
<p>There is sword-edged Citadel, and the
snow-flanked spike of Fusillade holding
court like a queen in this valley of peaks;
then the dome of Jackson and the Gunsight
notch. Our eyes are kept high, transfixed at
last by looming Heavy Runner and the distant
promise of Reynolds.</p>
<p>Looking for mountain goats, we scan
the walls around the sweep of Siyeh Bend,
catching a glimpse of the trail that crosses
the scree to hidden Piegan Pass.</p>
<p>Beargrass heads lean out above the road
like old men conferring on the view. The
purple trumpets of penstemon crowd the
rocks, and spots of Indian paintbrush lead
like a blood-trail to the higher slopes.</p>
<p>Intoxicated now, feeling the fresh full
force of the wind from Logan Pass, we race
on. We hardly notice the struggle of the
forest in Reynolds Creek far below, how it
thins and loses strength in its own hard
climb. We sweep past it on the broad magnificence
of this pass.</p>
<p>Level but a moment, the road dips to a
shelf on the headwall above Logan Creek
and swings over the great sculptured cliff of
the Garden Wall. For several kilometers this
masterpiece of a road glides down a constant
grade, squeezed between rock face
and space, twisting into tight drainages&mdash;a
road for storm lovers, wet with spray and
snow-seep, its quick turns concealing sudden
winds.</p>
<p>Mighty, snow-robed Heaven&rsquo;s Peak appears,
taking our attention from the Pass-group
mountains and the hanging valley
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
that spills Birdwoman Falls. Northward is
the great array of peaks encircling distant
Flattop, jumbles of mountains and glaciers.
How are we to notice the forest far below?</p>
<p>Not until we have passed the Loop and
are moving past the blackened snags of a recent
burn do we realize the stature of this
forest. The long road down will take us
into a valley much deeper than any on the
eastern side. Near Avalanche Creek are
trees we have seen nowhere else in the
park&mdash;giant western redcedars, western
hemlocks with their nodding tops, monstrous
black cottonwoods with bark so
deeply furrowed that it looks hewn by
hatchet.</p>
<p>We take a long ride down the valley,
past the low pyramid of Mt. Stanton, final
peak in the Livingston Range. Near the outlet
end of Lake McDonald, birch and aspen
again appear in numbers, and the road
enters a crowded stand of lodgepole pine.</p>
<p>Our memories cluttered with mountains,
waterfalls, and snowfields, we do not
quite realize the significance of this 80-kilometer
journey. We have crossed the boundaries
of several different plant-and-animal
communities, spanning a range of climate
that would be encountered on a 5,000-kilometer
north-south journey at sea level.</p>
<p>At first glance the various trees, wildflowers,
and animals seem randomly distributed,
scattered about like the distant
mountains. But mountainous terrain represents
an organized high-rise approach to
life. From the lowest, most protected valley
to the highest wind-and-ice-cut summit, the
life-forms align themselves, each according
to its own climatic tolerance.</p>
<p>Here too can be seen the great cycles
of nature: fire and regrowth, the building of
soil and its erosion, the incessant duel of the
eaters and the eaten.</p>
<p>In the following sections we will spend
some time in these various communities,
from prairie to tundra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h3 id="c7">Groves and Grasslands: The Prairie Sea</h3>
<p>There is something about spring on the
prairie that gets me up before dawn. I like
to watch the seasons change their guard
over the landscape, from the wintry cold of
pre-dawn dark to the spring-scented morning
air to the hot summer-foretaste of the
noon May sun.</p>
<p>Hoarfrost surrounds these patches of
pasqueflowers, blue goblets on downy
stems. On this windless night, frost has
formed everywhere, reclaiming for a time
its vast winter range, sparkling over the
green handiworks of spring.</p>
<p>But the god of the growing grasslands
is the sun, and it now proclaims itself,
stretching out to make the mountains shine.
With its assault the frost collapses, becoming
bright beads on grass tip and leaf joint
by which a beetle might refresh itself.</p>
<p>Spring is best perceived ant-level, at its
ground beginnings, where the bright yellow-green
tips of new grass shoots reclaim the
winter-blighted land. I look closely at a drag
line of spider silk; a necklace of dewdrops
slides down, collects to a moment&rsquo;s greatness,
in which I briefly see a curved horizon,
the morning sunburst, and myself, before it
falls away.</p>
<p>Getting up from my prone position, my
belly damp from the prairie earth, I startle
a whitetail jackrabbit; bounding high, it zigzags
off. The commotion disturbs a distant
badger, which faces about from its diggings
to confront danger in whatever form it might
take. It swings its snout to scent the air.
Somewhat uncertainly, it returns to the business
of hunting, then hesitates, swings about
once more and waits, myopic, patient.</p>
<p>Satisfied at last, the spurt of the now
distant rabbit lost in its brain, the creature
snorts a defiance at the mystery and resumes
its morning gopher hunt.</p>
<p>Overhead a marsh hawk skims past, its
flight erratic as a butterfly&rsquo;s. Far away a
magpie rattles at the passing hawk and
takes flight, briefly flashing black and white.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />It is easy to see only pieces in the natural
puzzle&mdash;a badger throwing dirt, horned
larks dipping into wind, black ants dragging
the rosette of a dead spider&mdash;and be satisfied
with the scattered scenes. But at last, to
make it meaningful, we must complete the
picture. There is that special joy in discovering
larger schemes: green plants utilizing
sunlight; a rabbit building its days at the
plants&rsquo; expense; the falcon tearing the rabbit
meat for its young; magpies picking at
the fallen falcon; and then, in the end, all
returning to the earth.</p>
<p>Here on the prairie, as in every plant-and-animal
association, the ancient drama
repeats itself over and over; the distant tundra
is a drastically different stage with different
actors, but the cycle is the same. Life
depends upon the interaction of all its
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
many forms. Unseen bacteria are as necessary
to the land as green grass; the meadow
vole and the coyote are as much a part of
the prairie as the grasses.</p>
<p>The secret of life rests in the wonder of
photosynthesis. Only green plants can manufacture
food from the earth&rsquo;s raw minerals.
This is the vital first step upon which the
great pyramid of animal and plant life is
built. Using energy from the sun, green
plants combine water and carbon dioxide to
synthesize sugar, and give off oxygen as a
by-product. The caterpillar takes its energy
from the plant tissue, converting to protein
the sugar and minerals in its body. The
caterpillar is then food for a spider or other
predator. A yellow warbler may take the
spider and in turn be ambushed by the
prairie falcon. Thus the energy produced by
the plant travels through the food chain.
When the prairie falcon dies, scavengers&mdash;including
insects and other invertebrates,
birds, and mammals&mdash;redistribute its wealth
among themselves; the rest is decomposed
by bacteria. Thus, eventually, the nutrients
on which the plants depend return to the soil.</p>
<p>When we look at any living organism,
whether it is plant, herbivore, carnivore,
parasite, scavenger, or decomposer, we are
soon made aware of its associations with
other living things, each puzzle piece leading
us to another and another. We begin to see
a picture whole&mdash;the fox, meadow mouse,
grasshopper, bunchgrass, and sparrow hawk&mdash;all
interlocked.</p>
<p>Geologically speaking, grasslands are a
recent development. As the Rocky Mountains
were being uplifted, the prevailing
warm, moist climate began to change. The
rising mountain mass intercepted moisture-laden
winds that blew in from the Pacific,
creating a rain shadow that lengthened eastward
as the mountains rose higher. A continental
climate, characterized by severe
winters and dry, wildfire summers gradually
took shape, extinguishing the great forests
that had grown across the continent&rsquo;s interior.
Herbaceous plants, which had been evolving
amid the forests, inherited the land.</p>
<p>Unlike trees, grasses die back to the
ground each winter, hoarding their life-germ
beneath the protecting soil. Growing
not from the tip but from the joints, grasses
regenerate quickly after fire or grazing.
Suspension of the normal metabolic processes
enable the grasses to go dormant and thus
survive periods of severe heat and drought.</p>
<p>Although the great prairie sea washes up
against Glacier&rsquo;s eastern boundary, with
estuaries probing into the mountain valleys
on the drier, south-facing slopes, the grassland
community comprises less than 5 percent of
the land area of Glacier National Park.
This includes the puddles of prairie west of
the Divide that interrupt the dense coniferous
forests along the North Fork of the
Flathead River.</p>
<p>From the pasqueflowers that bloom in
early May to the asters and goldenrod of
September, these summer-long gardens of
grasses and flowers lean with the wind. Here
are timothy, oatgrass and the bunchgrasses&mdash;rough
fescue, bluebunch fescue, and bluebunch
wheatgrass. Among the grasses bloom
bitterroot, blue camas, lupine, gaillardia,
balsamroot, cinquefoil, sticky geranium, and
wild rose.</p>

<p class="pcapc">From the lush redcedar-hemlock forest in
the McDonald Valley to the subalpine fir,
whitebark pine, and Engelmann spruce
struggling for existence near treeline, the
forests of Glacier reflect the conditions
of temperature, exposure, soil, and
drainage prevailing; and each forest has
its characteristic association of understory
trees and shrubs, herbaceous
ground cover, and vertebrate and
invertebrate animal life.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>Life Zones</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">Many physical and climatic factors
determine the range of Glacier&rsquo;s plant-and-animal
communities. Boundaries
between communities are seldom sharply
defined, but rather merge together in
broad zones of transition.</p>
<p class="pcapc">With elevation gain, average daily temperature drops
at the rate of 5&deg; per 900 meters. Precipitation, wind
velocity, and evaporation loss increase. Soil thins.
These factors, along with others such as fire frequency,
north or south exposure, and availability of moisture,
combine to determine the range of each community.</p>
<p class="pcapc">In the forest community below 1,800 meters, Douglas-fir,
lodgepole pine, and western larch predominate. In the
valleys, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir are found.
The somewhat lower and much better watered western
valleys of the park support western redcedar and
western hemlock.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Treeline is the upper limit to which the tolerances of
trees to environmental conditions permit them to grow.
Because there are so many controlling factors (wind,
temperature, exposure to sunlight, snow cover, etc.)
treeline in the diagram is only approximate. In Glacier
it averages 2,000 meters. Avalanche chutes or sheer
cliff walls may suppress it to below 1,500 meters; on
protected slopes it may be as high as 2,150 meters.</p>
<p class="pcapc">At the eastern edge of the park below 1,200 meters, the
forest gives way to the prairie community, composed
mostly of soft-stemmed plants adapted to the conditions
of low precipitation that prevail here in the rainshadow
of the mountain range. Clumps of aspen, found in the
prairie in sheltered spots, occur here in the transition
zone between prairie and forest.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>A Mountain Profile</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">This diagram represents the eastward-facing
slope of a hypothetical mountain
near the eastern boundary of Glacier
National Park. Its life communities are
somewhat different from those of
mountain slopes at the western edge,
chiefly because of the differential in
annual precipitation.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Illustration: Here, above approximately 2,750 meters, in a realm of
ice, snow, and barren rock, there is little life.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><span class="large"><b>Alpine tundra</b></span></p>
<p class="pcapc">Below 2,750 meters and above 2,000 meters, depending
on other factors such as exposure to sun and wind and
steepness of terrain, exists the alpine tundra community,
with vegetation similar to that of the vast,
essentially level, treeless zones of the Arctic.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><span class="large"><b>Scrub-forest</b></span></p>
<p class="pcapc">Roughly between 1,800 and 2,000 meters, the dominant
vegetation is scrub-forest. Trees here are stunted;
except in sheltered spots they are more or less prone
rather than upright. Net growth is slow, not only because
of the short growing season but also because
of the pruning effect of icy mountain winds. Very
few tree species can survive in this harsh habitat.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><span class="large"><b>Coniferous forest</b></span></p>
<p class="pcapc">In the forest community below 1,800 meters, Douglas
fir, lodgepole pine, and western larch predominate. In
the valleys, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir are
found. The somewhat lower and much better watered
western valleys of the park support western redcedar
and western hemlock. See <a href="#Page_54">page 54</a></p>

<p class="pcap"><b>The Forest Community</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">A forest is organized vertically like an
apartment house or office building, with
layers corresponding to stories. The
<i>canopy</i> is the branches and foliage of
tall trees that form a roof over the
community. Below the canopy are the
<i>understory</i> trees: young individuals of
the canopy species; and small, shade-tolerant
trees that will never become part
of the canopy. Beneath the understory
branches is the <i>shrub layer</i>, occupied by
knee-high-to-man-high woody plants;
beneath that is the <i>herb layer</i>, where most
of the ferns, wildflowers, grasses, and
smaller woody plants grow. The <i>forest
floor</i> is the zone of mosses, mushrooms,
creeping plants, and forest litter (leaves,
twigs, needles, feathers, bits of bark,
animal droppings, etc.). The forest has a
&ldquo;basement,&rdquo; too, interlaced by plant
roots, mycelia of fungi, and tunnels of
myriad animals.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Each layer of the forest has its characteristic
animal species, but most forage
over more than one level. Some nest in
one story and feed in another. The red
squirrel races back and forth from the
forest floor to the highest branches.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The forest community also has a socio-economic
organization. Every animal (and
plant) takes up space and consumes
a portion of the available nutrients.
Each has a place in the community
food chain&mdash;as, for example, <i>herbivore</i>,
<i>carnivore</i>, or <i>scavenger</i>. Each directly or
indirectly affects all the other organisms.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>The Forest Community</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">The role of a species in the community, like the job and social
function of a person, is its <i>niche</i>. Similar species of animals have different niches,
thus lessening competition for food and living space. Thrushes hunt close to the
ground; vireos and kinglets hunt among the branches; flycatchers snap up
airborne insects. The flicker feeds upon insects, excavates nesting holes that are
later occupied by other species such as squirrels and owls, and is preyed upon
by the great horned owl; its niche is <i>insect exterminator / food for carnivores / homebuilder</i>.
The great horned owl, hunting mammals, birds, and reptiles by night,
preys on species different from those hunted by the goshawk, and thus
occupies a parallel niche. When it dies, its remains, like those of other animals,
are decomposed and return to the soil.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>Sun, Green Plants, and Animals</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">The sun is the source of energy for any
plant-and-animal community. Green
plants draw nitrogen and minerals from
the soil, and in a process called photosynthesis
use sunlight to convert raw
materials (carbon dioxide and water) into
carbohydrates (sugar, starch, cellulose),
giving off oxygen as a by-product.
Besides burning oxygen, animals depend
on plants for food.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>Green Plants</b>, trees and shrubs, grasses
and sedges, wildflowers, ferns, mosses,
algae and lichens&mdash;are fed upon by
animals, which are unable to manufacture
their own food.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>The Redback Vole</b>, like other rodents,
pikas and hares, seed-eating birds,
grazing and browsing hoofed animals,
and herbivorous insects, derives its
energy from the seeds and other parts
of green plants that it eats.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>The Garter Snake</b>, feeding upon the vole,
is dependent upon plants even though it
does not eat them.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>The Great Horned Owl</b>, preying upon the
garter snake, is one more step removed
from the green plants&mdash;but still
dependent on them.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>Scavengers</b> such as carrion beetles feed
upon the carcass of the owl; the remains
are then attacked by <b>Decomposers</b>,
primarily bacteria, that break down the
animal tissues into basic organic
compounds.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><b>The Soil</b>, enriched by the minerals and
carbon and nitrogen compounds added to
it by the decomposers (and by other
processes such as fire) supports new
green plant growth.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Thus energy derived from the sun flows
through the ecosystem in a food chain.
A plant-and-animal community is a
complex, interlocking web of such food
chains.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>A Pyramid of Numbers</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">Necessarily, the number of plants in an
ecosystem far exceeds the number of
plant eaters, and the number of prey
species must exceed the number of predators.
During its lifetime, a golden eagle
will consume a vast number of lesser
animals. The combined mass of prey
animals necessary to sustain an eagle
greatly outweighs the eagle itself. Ecologists
refer to this proportional relationship
of mass between each link in the
food chain as the <i>pyramid of numbers</i>.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The diagram represents a numbers
pyramid for the alpine zone. Because of
its limiting environment, the alpine zone
supports a lesser plant mass than the
forest zone. As a result, the carrying
capacity of the alpine is less than that
of the forest.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><span class="large"><b>1 Kilo</b></span></p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Tertiary</i> (third-order) <i>consumers</i> are the predators
(Golden Eagle, Swainson&rsquo;s Hawk, etc.) that feed upon
other predators. Because of the 90% loss of energy at
each level of the food chain, there will be very few
hawks and eagles in comparison to the numbers of
marmots.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><span class="large"><b>10 Kilos</b></span></p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Secondary consumers</i> are the predators (weasels,
shrews, carnivorous insects and birds, etc.) that eat
herbivores. The animals at this level of the pyramid are
often&mdash;though not always&mdash;larger than the animals they
feed upon. But they are much less numerous, because
it takes many prey animals to sustain one predator.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><span class="large"><b>100 Kilos</b></span></p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Primary consumers</i> (plant eaters, or herbivores) convert
plant tissue into animal flesh. In the process about
90% of the energy stored as plant food is lost, mostly
as heat energy. In the alpine community the herbivores
include pikas, marmots, ground squirrels, and ptarmigan,
as well as herbivorous insects.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><span class="large"><b>1,000 Kilos</b></span></p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Producers</i> are the green plants at the base of the food
pyramid, manufacturing food for the animals of the
alpine community. The <i>biomass</i> (total weight) of each
level of the food chain is ten times (more or less) the
weight of the stage above it: 1,000 kilos of green plants
will produce only 100 kilos of primary consumers.</p>

<p class="pcap">The water ouzel, or dipper, a creature of fast mountain
water, is admirably outfitted to cope with its
demanding environment. Stubby wings, chunky body,
short tail, and oily plumage allow it to walk under
water, where it scavenges for aquatic insect larvae and
small fish. In flying up- and down-stream, ouzels never
shortcut but follow the winding streamcourse.</p>
<p class="pcapc">As long as there is open water, the dipper suffers no
hardship from the mountain winter. Then, when the land
is shut down and lakes are frozen over, this little bird
carries on in its mountain-stream habitat, plunging into
the cold water to find food, and pausing occasionally to
sing.</p>

range. In a severe winter many starve. But in a
balanced ecosystem such loss is not waste, for the
carrion helps sustain scavengers; it is an important
initial food source for bears emerging from hibernation.</p>

<p>Conspicuous also are many insects&mdash;including
grasshoppers; flies; ants, wasps and
bees; butterflies and moths; bugs; and beetles&mdash;which
fulfill important roles as herbivores,
carnivores, and scavengers while also acting
as pollinators for flowering plants and providing
an abundant food source for other
animals.</p>
<p>Below the ground are the tunnels. Burrowing
is an important means of survival on
the open prairie, and life underground is
extensive. Some of the animals are rarely
seen&mdash;the northern pocket gopher, for example,
with a diet of underground insects,
grubs, worms, and roots, spends most of its
life tunneling just below the surface. Others,
like the badger, leave their burrows during
the day to dig for rodents. Most conspicuous
of the burrowing animals in the park&rsquo;s
grasslands is the Columbian ground squirrel.
Its alert upright stance has earned it the
nickname &ldquo;picket pin.&rdquo; When danger approaches
from the air or on land, its shrill
alarm whistle passes the warning to others
of its kind.</p>
<p>Where prairie and forest meet, a never-ending
struggle for dominion is waged. The
isolated patches of prairie that dot the
North Fork Valley near Polebridge hold the
great forest of the park&rsquo;s northwest region
at bay.</p>
<p>This broad valley, floored with coarse
glacial outwash and terraced downward to
the deep channel of the North Fork River,
presents a graphic battleground between
grass and tree. Lining the upper terraces,
from which they glower down on the dry,
well drained grass flats like a line of warriors,
are the Douglas-fir, western larch, and
ponderosa pine. Seedling trees continually
invade the prairie. But most perish early,
their shallow roots no match for the extensive
root systems of the fast-growing, moisture-greedy
grasses. If encouraged by a
series of wet summers, however, the young
lodgepoles quickly gain stature. They had
made significant inroads at Big Prairie when
the disastrously dry summer of 1967 killed
most of these 15-year-old pioneer trees.</p>
<p>These North Fork grasslands and the
immediately surrounding lodgepole pine forests
are an important spring range. Deer,
wapiti, and grizzly&mdash;and, in the wetter
areas, moose&mdash;graze or browse here. And
here, low on the western slopes of the
Livingston Range, are the park&rsquo;s only stands
of ponderosa pine, a tree that prefers warm,
dry habitats. As a result, at low elevations it
often merges with the prairie community.</p>
<p>Groves of aspen colonize the eastern
prairies in areas where there is sufficient
water and protection from wind. These aspen
parklands are important havens for
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
animals. Wherever two differing communities
interact, a phenomenon known as
&ldquo;edge effect&rdquo; occurs. Here wildlife exists
in abundance; the animals that favor forest
cover mingle freely with those that prefer
open areas. Aspen groves&mdash;supporting
grasses, herbs, and shrubs beneath their thin
canopies&mdash;are favored haunts for grouse,
varying hare, deer, and wapiti, all of which
find among the trees abundant food, shelter
and concealment. Populations of insects,
small mammals, and birds, which are high
for the same reasons, attract a wide range of
predators.</p>
<p>Isolated aspen groves are characteristically
dome-shaped. Because aspens are
capable of reproducing themselves vegetatively,
the grove slowly expands outward
from the parent tree. As a result, most of
these groves are either exclusively male or
exclusively female.</p>
<p>Since quick-growing aspens provide a
bountiful food source for beaver, streams
near these trees are often dammed by the
rodents flooding lowlands and creating additional
habitat in the form of willow flats.
Another &ldquo;edge effect&rdquo; is established, attracting
animals found near water. Waterfowl,
marsh birds, moose, mink, muskrat, skunks,
amphibians, and many others find such areas
to their liking.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />Before the appearance of the white man,
these eastern prairies were a paradise for
animals. Once, on the summit of Rising
Wolf, light-headed from the climb and the
view of endless prairie, I fancied that I saw
that vast, undisturbed animal panorama
spread before me.</p>
<p>Principally there were the bison, darkening
the uneven land. Pronghorn bands
flashed white on ridgetops, and moose
moved through the long fingers of willow
that extended eastward with the rivers.
Caribou and wolves inhabited the shadows.
Among vast cities of prairie dogs, swift fox
and grizzly roamed. There were the clamorings
of sandhill crane, and white clouds of
trumpeter swans.</p>
<p>This land, endowed with a wealth of
wild grass, wore its wilderness well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h3 id="c8">The Forest</h3>
<p>On Gunsight Pass, the rain lancing down, I
found a sharpedged rock that split the
continent in two. On both sides the rain
rivulets ran down, a fraction of an inch
determining the stream&rsquo;s destination: Pacific
or Atlantic.</p>
<p>The Continental Divide is a mighty
barrier, a line of consequence that does
more than determine watersheds. Its effect
in Glacier is dramatic, as a look at the
forests will reveal.</p>
<p>Obstructing the eastward flow of the
moisture-laden Pacific winds, the Divide
extracts a heavy annual tribute of precipitation
from the air mass, forcing it to rise
up the mountain chain, where it cools and
condenses. Chief benefactors are the low
western valleys, which respond with a lush
growth of Pacific coastal-type forests.</p>
<p>The eastern valleys, however, deprived
of abundant annual moisture and exposed to
the wind and temperature ravages of the
prairie&rsquo;s continental climate, support a
dramatically different kind of forest. Here
Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir are the
climax trees, contrasted with such trees as
the western redcedar and western hemlock
of the mild and moist McDonald valley.</p>
<p>Elevation exerts an additional restriction
on the distribution of tree species.
Since climatic conditions vary with change
in elevation&mdash;lower temperatures resulting in
shorter growing seasons, and increased wind
exposure resulting in greater loss of moisture
through evaporation&mdash;we would expect
to find the forest composition change as
we ascend a mountain slope. In Glacier,
eastern valleys average 240 meters higher
than western, and thus even if they had
more moisture they would not sustain the
redcedars and hemlocks. All plants have
range limits, some narrow, some broad; and
they excel where their particular set of
preferences as to moisture, soil, sunlight,
and wind exposure are best met. On sites
that do not meet their optimum requirements,
they face being crowded out by
species better adapted to the prevailing
conditions.</p>
<p>Physical features of the land determine
vegetation also. Certain trees prefer the
moist areas along a streambed&mdash;the great
black cottonwoods, for example. And on
steep hillsides, avalanches prevent the
growth of climax trees, permitting instead
only shrubby, pliant growth&mdash;mountain-ash,
mountain maple, alder, menziesia.</p>
<p>Forest communities are named for
their dominant tree species. Thus, an area
in which Douglas-fir dominates is called a
&ldquo;Douglas-fir forest.&rdquo; Glacier does have
forests in which Douglas-fir is the climax
species; these are chiefly dry areas, below
1,800 meters, with south and west exposures.
But we usually associate the park with its
Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests,
found extensively between 1,200 and 2,100
meters, and with the western redcedar-western
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
hemlock forests in the McDonald
valley.</p>
<p>Because forests mature slowly and
change is usually imperceptible, we are
tempted to think of them as static and eternal.
But since a forest is a community of
living things, it responds to changes in the
environment. Subtle physical or climatic
changes, such as a rising or falling water
table or a slight increase or decrease in
annual precipitation, will favor some species
of trees and hinder others, eventually altering
the composition of the forest.</p>
<p>Other changes are more dramatic. Most
notable of these is fire.</p>

<p>Heat lightning, glimmering soundless behind
the western peaks. Then the first low rumble.
At first the flashing had been from
cloud to cloud, but now, as the storm
nears, the first ground-spears appear,
lighting up the night. Here is a big storm,
many-celled, engulfing more and more territory
beneath its angry bulk. Lightning
dances into the dry August forest. In their
towers the lookouts stay awake.</p>
<p>Close strike and a flare-up! The ridge
snag burns like a Roman candle, sending
bright embers down. Valley, ridge, and peak
blink on and off with blue light as the
storm roars like night-firing artillery.</p>
<p>Passing overhead, the low cloud belly
brings a sudden lash of rain. But it is not
enough: tomorrow will mean long hours
of fire watch.</p>
<p>The next day dawns clear, a morning
of heavy dew. The ridge strikes did not
ignite the forest. Inspecting the storm path,
aircraft and lookouts find no evidence of
fire.</p>
<p>But two days later, in a morning of
high wind, thin smoke plumes rise upward.
Smoldering in the thick duff of the forest
floor, a lingering hot spot explodes with
the fanning wind. It quickly spreads from
a hectare to ten while the quadrants are
called in and the hot-shot crews dispatched;
then to a hundred, bringing in the smoke
jumpers and mobilizing the vast fire-control
network. A thousand hectares, perhaps ten
thousand might burn this week of big fires.</p>
<p>In the resulting skeleton forest, the
scene of devastation is almost overpowering:
life seems forevermore excluded from
this blackened ruin. But fire is nothing new
to forest communities. We may think fire
demonic because it takes from our life span
this block of mature forest, a sight we will
never again see in this place. But nature
does not operate in terms of human time
scales. This forest is simply pushed back
closer to its starting point, to begin again
its long progression toward a climax vegetation
cover.</p>
<h4>Forest Succession</h4>
<p>Through a series of complex vegetation
stages, each characterized by different herbs,
trees, and shrubs, the forest slowly returns
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
to the type of vegetation best suited to the
physical and climatic conditions of the site;
this is called a climax community. The fact
that most of Glacier&rsquo;s forests are in some
stage of recovery from fire accounts in part
for the mosaic of forest cover found here.</p>
<p>The forest of Huckleberry Mountain
on the Camas Creek road was consumed in
the 1967 fire. By 1969, among the charred,
lifeless trunks of the former forest, lush
grass and sunloving fireweed, thistle, and
paintbrush were growing. And by 1974 lodgepole
pine seedlings along the road were a
meter or two high. Lodgepole is a fast-growing
tree that requires full sun to germinate.
Forest fire is necessary for the regeneration
of these trees: the intense heat causes the
tightly closed cones to open, releasing
the seeds that will establish the forest. So
young pines developed among fireweed,
spiraea, willow, and mountain maple shrubs.</p>
<p>The lodgepole forest near the western
entrance to the park has been developing
since 1929, when fire destroyed the redcedar-hemlock
forest in the area between Apgar
and West Glacier. Beneath the scattered
spires of old larch that survived the burn,
the lodgepoles have now grown up, forming
a canopy that shades the forest floor. Because
lodgepole live only about 80 years
and will not germinate in shade, this forest
will not exist long. Shade-tolerant Douglas-fir,
white pine, Engelmann spruce and
western redcedar seedlings are now taking
hold. But the physical characteristics of
this area&mdash;the climate, terrain, and soil&mdash;are
ultimately most favorable for western redcedar
and hemlock; and unless other disruptions
intervene, this area will eventually
again become a dense redcedar-hemlock
forest.</p>
<p>But this will not happen quickly. The
soil after hundreds of years of collecting debris
will again become rich and moist. Young
hemlocks will germinate on and near
decaying logs. When old larches, firs,
and pines fall, the slow-growing redcedars
and hemlocks will take their places in the
canopy.</p>
<p>Forest succession is a more complicated
story than this; it is a fascinating study involving
herbs, shrubs, small and large
trees, and animal populations. From location
to location it will vary; only in its broad
outlines is it predictable. It is based on the
observation that, given time, a forest&mdash;or
any other plant community&mdash;will progress
until it reaches climax&mdash;that is, the stage
that will perpetuate itself.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />How then are we to think about fire? Increasingly,
experts are concerned not so
much with fire suppression as with fire
management. For suppression has at least
three disadvantages: it allows the accumulation
of unburned fuels that can result in
&ldquo;fire storms&rdquo; when they are finally ignited;
an undiversified climax forest is more vulnerable
to disease than is a mixed forest;
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
and a dense forest canopy discourages shrub
growth, an important food source for deer,
wapiti, moose, and smaller animals.</p>
<p>As the well-being of the deer herd depends
on the predators that thin its numbers,
so the long-term well-being of the forest
depends on fire to rejuvenate it periodically.
We must realize that wilderness is identified
with fire, landslide, avalanche, windfall, and
flood. Nature not only has learned to cope
with these agents of change&mdash;she depends
upon them for maintaining the delicate
balances between landscape and life. There
is in the business of nature, after all, more
than the pleasing of man&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<h4>Spruce Morning</h4>
<p>Of all times to get a rock in my boot! I had
just started out, the morning was still cool
in this eastern valley, and the heavy pack
was not yet biting into my shoulders. Sitting
down beside the trail, I leaned the pack
against the base of an old spruce and began
unlacing.</p>
<p>I could hear the scratching of the red
squirrel descending to investigate, but I
didn&rsquo;t look up until it let go with long indignant
chatter at finding its territory invaded.
I plunked out the pebble and began relacing
my boot. Cautiously the squirrel came down,
pausing frequently to scold, its lower jaw
quivering with rage and exposing yellow
rodent teeth. Neighboring squirrels joined
in and soon the trees danced with flicking
tails.</p>
<p>Down the squirrel came, almost to the
ground, then raced back up the tree, stopping
at each lateral branch to deliver a
vocal broadside. Finding no danger to themselves,
the other squirrels soon quit the
uproar and went about their morning business.
I was beginning to suspect that I was
committing some graver offense than the
mere exercise of squatters&rsquo; rights&mdash;perhaps I
threatened its cache of fir cones. Then into
the corner of my vision shot another form,
streaking soundless as a shadow; the squirrel
also saw it&mdash;but too late. With a thin
terrified squeak, the rodent started to go
higher; but the pine marten was above it.
The squirrel quickly reversed itself, sending
bits of bark showering down.</p>
<p>As the squirrel leaped from the tree in
desperation, the marten overtook it in mid-air;
they came down together. Clamping the
limp creature firmly in its jaws, the marten
strode up the incline of a fallen spruce.
Before it hopped off onto a shelf of higher
ground to disappear, it looked briefly back
at me. I fancied I could read, fixed in its
eyes, a certain recognition of my having
distracted its prey.</p>
<p>A breeze made me shiver, snapping me
back from that swift vision of luxuriant fur,
that blinding grace which flashed its orange
throat-patch through the trees, and I realized
I was sweating. For a moment I had been
that squirrel, eyes wide with terror, seeing
fate bear down, and powerless before the
natural order of things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The incident got the other squirrels
singing again; but the confidence was gone,
and soon it was quiet. What dreams do
squirrels dream, I wondered, looking
around. I saw that place more clearly then,
having been caught between a marten and
its prey. I saw each spruce: its age, its condition,
the onslaughts it had borne; the
beargrass coming up in an opening; and
down the trail a meadow that was yellow,
white, and red with sulphur plant, mariposa,
and Indian paintbrush. Bees, flies, spiders,
and butterflies worked that little garden
tucked among the crowding trees. Countless
forms of life beneath the soil and bark, in
tunnel, crevice, hole, and pocket, working
unseen to sustain their lives, and somehow,
when all were added up, maintaining the
forest as well.</p>
<p>A flicker called, its loud <i>Klee-yer</i> breaking
the forest hush. Birds, mammals, plants,
insects&mdash;all hide together here, their lives
so skillfully embroidered that no loose
thread exists that my mind might grasp
to unravel and understand the work.</p>
<p>The forest had once been a place that
obstructed my view, a great blank to stride
through, a few hours of necessary blur
before the high lake or pass was reached.
Now I was quite content to remain awhile
beneath these great-boled trees.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />A forest, like the mountains themselves,
supports various levels of life. The floor and
substratum are a great processing plant where
bacteria, fungi, and insects work, decomposing
the plant and animal litter, recycling
dead and discarded tissue back to simpler
organic compounds, gases, and minerals,
thereby providing sustenance for growing
plants. As spiders, shrews, wrens, and
thrushes seem to know, there is good hunting
on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Just above the forest floor is the herb
layer, a seasonal layer of growth including
flowers, mushrooms, grasses, and other
small plants.</p>
<p>Above that grows the shrub layer, then
the understory of young trees awaiting their
chance to take a place in the forest&rsquo;s canopy
high above. From the swaying canopy, exposed
to the full force of sun and wind, to
the dim, moist floor, the forest provides a
wide range of habitat.</p>
<p>Relatively few animals live in the treetops.
The almost incessant motion makes
nesting too hazardous for birds. Red squirrels
venture up to cut cones in the canopy,
but store their booty and make their nests
farther down.</p>
<p>In the mid-range between canopy and
understory, goshawks and Cooper&rsquo;s hawks
nest. Woodpeckers, nuthatches, and sapsuckers
forage on the tree trunks and nest
in cavities they excavate or appropriate. Red
squirrels and the nocturnal flying squirrels
create a major traffic here, along with the
martens and owls that hunt them.</p>
<p>The understory and shrub layers house
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
the greatest numbers of nesting birds. Here
the effects of storm and rain are minimized
and protective cover is greatest. Vireos,
thrushes, warblers, hummingbirds, bluebirds,
flycatchers, and others can be found among
the tangle of this sometimes impenetrable
layer.</p>
<p>The most populated area, the forest
floor, supports an astonishing abundance of
organisms. Below the busy traffic of mice,
shrews, and larger animals is a bewildering
array of insects and other invertebrates. The
attrition rate in the litter of the forest floor&mdash;a
continual battleground difficult to comprehend&mdash;is
enormous. The smaller the organism,
the greater its numbers are likely
to be. This humus-rich, moist soil teems
with bacteria, and a handful will contain
surprising numbers of small spiders, pseudo-scorpions
and almost microscopic mites.</p>
<p>Each year some two to three thousand
kilograms, dry weight, of falling material
litter an average hectare of forest. All this
plant and animal waste&mdash;twigs, leaves,
limbs, fallen trees, feathers, hair, feces, and
carcasses&mdash;is processed by the armies of
decomposers that thrive on the forest floor.
With the aid of larger creatures that break
up the plant and animal tissue, most microscopic
bacteria are able to decompose from
a hundred to a thousand times their own
weight every day.</p>
<p>Few trees die of old age in the forest.
The seedling mortality rate is necessarily
high, since far greater numbers of seeds
germinate each year than can reach maturity.
Of those that do, many fall victim to
the ever-present dangers of disease, insect
infestation, windfall, stream erosion, and
fire. Insects alone present a formidable
threat to trees, for they have evolved every
means of attack&mdash;chewing and mining
leaves, boring into twigs, eating cambium
and heartwood, sucking sap, triggering galls.
If the insect world did not police itself,
aided by spiders, insectivorous birds and
other animals, forests and other plantlife
would quickly fade before the chewing, boring,
sucking horde.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />Through the trees the light on Citadel shows
the morning slipping by. As I start to get
up I see a garter snake sliding out into
the dusty trail, seeking the sun-warmed
earth. Moving slowly, alert for danger, it
probes the air frequently with its sensitive
tongue. But against the lightcolored duff
its dark shape offers a fine target, begging
attack. A chipmunk, watching from a nearby
lookout stump, twitches its tail nervously
over its back, curious&mdash;perhaps suspicious&mdash;at
the sight of a snake. Very slightly the
snake&rsquo;s head goes up, its tongue flickering.
For a few seconds reptile and rodent regard
each other. Then the chipmunk drops back
soundlessly into its hollow stump, and the
snake lowers its head onto warm ground.</p>
<p>Some day soon, a sparrowhawk or weasel
will interrupt the snake&rsquo;s morning sun-bath.
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
The snake will fuel bird or mammal
for a time, as mice, fledgling birds, and
insects now sustain the snake. The chipmunk
too, rummaging nearby, lives in
shadows of talon and tooth.</p>
<p>Until that time of sharp encounter,
each has its own niche, a way of life, a shaft
of sun, and food enough.</p>
<h4>A Walk in the Redcedar Forest</h4>
<p>Climax! The word takes on a true significance
here, among these broad-based trees.
When you enter this forest the road noise
does not follow far&mdash;as, when you walk into
a cave and turn a corner, sound and light
are left behind. There is a surprising spaciousness,
a feeling of openness in a mature
western redcedar forest. With scant understory
and the canopy so far above and
everywhere complete, it seems like some
vast, high-ceilinged catacomb, pillared by
the huge, shaggy-barked cedars and the
deeply scored trunks of the black cottonwoods.
The floor is strewn with fallen giants
in magnificent disarray, uplifted roots still
grasping fractured rock.</p>
<p>A rainy day is a good time to walk a
cedar trail, when the dull light seems to
shine from the wet moss, making the underleaves
of devil&rsquo;s-club and Rocky Mountain
maple glow. Wind and rain, like light,
penetrate with difficulty the latticework of
this canopy; thin lines of fog develop over
the bogs. The air is fresh with growing
plants, snow-cold still when the first spring
flowers appear.</p>
<p>Fiddleheads of unfolding lady ferns line
the trail in May, pushing up from the hub
of last year&rsquo;s leveled, lifeless fronds. Beds
of trillium shine their white, three-pointed
flowers like flashlights in the dark recesses.
Unlike the small, hidden calypso orchid,
which bears its purple spikes and yellow
throat low above the moss, the trilliums
make no secret of spring growth. They are
bold, handsome plants, broad-leaved and
tall, with waxy white petals that tinge to purple
in their month-long bloom.</p>
<p>Moss covers everything. Boulders are
green and weightless-looking, resilient and
topped with miniature forests of cedar
seedlings. Ancient fallen trees are disguised
with blankets of moss, sprouting
hemlock here and there. The rich greens
that characterize Glacier&rsquo;s summers seem
to begin here amid the moisture-glossed
leaves of twinflower, bunchberry and bead-lily.</p>
<p>Later, the spiders will spin thousands of
kilometers of gossamer filament among the
trees. The orb-weavers will hang their webs
high and low, suspended in every opening.
Walking through the forest then, you will see
shafts of sunlight whirling in the higher
webs until they seem like tops set spinning
among the treetrunks.</p>
<p>Indianpipes, the &ldquo;ghost flowers&rdquo; that
need no light to grow, will break through
the forest soil. Like mushrooms, with fruiting
bodies that are nourished by underground
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
mycelia, these saprophytes absorb
their nutrients from a fungus that covers
their roots.</p>
<p>Receiving an average of about 18 centimeters
more annual precipitation than
forests east of the Divide, Glacier&rsquo;s redcedar-hemlock
community hoards its moisture.
Its dense growth and the surrounding
mountain walls inhibit the circulation of
drying winds. Mosses and ferns transpire
their moisture, which you can feel; place
your hand close, and you will sense a coolness
like the air exuding from an ice cave.
Draped from the tree limbs are long filaments
of squawhair and goatsbeard, black
and grey lichen strands that flourish in the
damp air.</p>
<p>Except for the black bear, few large
animals inhabit the deep forest. Grizzlies
find better forage in meadows or along the
forest edge. Since shade discourages shrubby
undergrowth, deer and wapiti will search
elsewhere for browse. In summer, wapiti,
grizzlies, and mule deer bucks tend to
wander up into high meadows.</p>
<p>Contrasted to the noisy, conspicuous
birds of the prairie&mdash;meadowlarks and bobolinks&mdash;birds
of the forest seem elusive
and secretive. Although numerous, the
varied thrushes, Townsend&rsquo;s solitaires, and
Swainson&rsquo;s thrushes are seldom seen; but
when approached, they fly silently off and are
swallowed by the forest shadow.</p>
<p>There seems to be serenity in a mature
forest, as though the struggle for life is
somehow suspended, the needs of the animals
here less urgent, muffled. The towering
redcedar forest seems to be no battlefield
at all, but rather a monument to what
Earth can do.</p>
<h4>The Perpendicular Night</h4>
<p>Behind Avalanche campground a trail leads
back toward Lake McDonald Lodge. I decided
to follow it one June evening, to experience
the sensation of the deep forest
changing into night. With the nearby mountain
wall intercepting the sun, dusk comes
early to this valley. On the prairie, night
passes across the landscape in an even line,
forthright as a waxing tide; you can almost
feel the globe in its turning from the sun.
There is reassurance in the night&rsquo;s coming,
its steady purple doming over the sky.</p>
<p>But here darkness seems to sprout from
the earth. It collects beneath the hemlock
clumps, bridges the creekbottoms. It seems
to flit from place to place. You look about,
uneasy, trying to catch it here or there, but
always miss its infiltrations. It captures the
narrow clearings when you look away;
pockets of tree-darkness join together,
forcing the light upward until the tree-tops
seem impossibly bright and distant.</p>
<p>Through the trees I could see a dozen
fires dance in the growing shadow, wood-smoke
and camp sounds filling the air.
Turning uptrail, I felt a reluctance to leave
the presence of those fires&mdash;a senseless feeling,
but strong. A growing forest-dread impelled
me almost physically backward to
those circles of firelight. I felt the need to
be near a fire, to be reassured by heat and
light. Fire was our greatest friend, our
greatest weapon. With it we beat the long
ages of ice and held the forest gloom
away. There was no harm here, only silence;
yet the longer I walked, with beard-moss
hanging down like daggers all around,
the more I craved the comradeship of fire.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b id="f2fig3">The Vital Predator</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">The merciless law of predation might at
first thought seem cruel; but the predator
plays a vital part in maintaining the
balance of the biotic community. Without
the controlling factor of predation, prey
species quickly enlarge their populations.
If plant eaters are not checked, the resulting
excess population exceeds the
carrying capacity of the range. Food
supply rapidly diminishes. In a damaged
range, competition and stress result,
usually culminating in a massive die-off
through starvation and disease.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Ironically, predators thus provide a service
to their prey. First to fall to the predator
are the old, the diseased, the unwary, and
the young. By removing many young and
old deer from a typical herd, cougars
lessen competition among the deer for
choice range, thus tending to keep herbivore
numbers at parity with the land&rsquo;s
carrying capacity. Only the strongest and
wariest deer survive, ensuring that the
fittest will continue the species. When
man upsets this delicate balance&mdash;destroying
predators in the hope of increasing
numbers of game animals&mdash;the
result is ecological disaster. In the 1930s,
in a misguided attempt to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; the
whitetail deer herds of the park&rsquo;s North
Fork area, many coyotes and cougars
were exterminated. In 1935 alone, 50
cougars were killed. Relieved of the pressure
of predation, the deer flourished. In a
few years, however, the normally adequate
range was severely overbrowsed. Suffering
also from this imbalance were wapiti
(&ldquo;elk&rdquo;) and moose, ungulates that share
the winter range with deer.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Some predators are more specialized
than others. The Canada lynx, for
example, has oversize feet, an adaptation
that helps it move across deep snow
without breaking the surface. As a result,
it is an efficient predator of the snowshoe
hare, another large-footed animal. Relying
on this adaptation, the lynx feeds almost
exclusively on snowshoe hares. Consequently,
its numbers inevitably fluctuate
with the 10-year &ldquo;boom and bust&rdquo; cycle of
the snowshoe.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The coyote, on the other hand, is a
generalized predator, exploiting whatever
prey is currently abundant. Should mice
or ground squirrels be in short supply, it
will subsist on anything from grasshoppers
to berries until favored prey again becomes
available. (Animals that normally
eat both plant and animal food are
referred to as omnivores.) Generalized
predators are thus better equipped to
survive temporary ecological imbalances,
maintaining their numbers at relatively
consistent levels from year to year.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Carnivores all, the animals on these pages

<p class="pcap"><b id="f2fig4">Protective Coloration</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">To escape extermination, each species
must in some manner foil its enemies.
Protective coloration is one of the more
common adaptations helping to do this.
Most animals resemble their environment
to some extent. The conspicuous
markings of some, like the bitter-tasting
monarch butterfly or the striped skunk,
seem to function as a warning to
prospective predators that it is in their
best interest to look elsewhere for a meal.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Some animals, such as the white-tailed
ptarmigan and the snowshoe hare, have
seasonal changes in plumage or pelage,
wearing white in winter and brown in
summer. Even predators, such as
longtail and shorttail weasels, benefit
from seasonal camouflage. Protective
coloration makes them less noticeable
to prey species and to larger predators.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Many insects, too, change coloration with
the season. Bright green grasshoppers of
early summer become more brown with
each molt, matching the changes in the
surrounding vegetation.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Obliterative shading</i> is especially important
to animals that frequent more than
one habitat. Seen from above, turtles
match their dark background; from below,
because of their lighter underbody
shading they blend into the bright
skylight.</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Disruptive coloration</i> aids in breaking up
an animal&rsquo;s outline. Butterflies and moths
commonly have disruptive wing markings.
The distinctive shapes of eyes can be
concealed. Eye coloration may mimic
body color&mdash;as in the green katydid&mdash;or
the eye may continue disruptive body
markings.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Ground-nesting birds are especially vulnerable
to attack. Their eggs tend to be
heavily blotched with earthy colors,
making them less conspicuous. Chicks
also carry these disruptive colorations on
natal down.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Most mammals, with coats of brown or
gray, are inconspicuous when motionless.
Deer fawns are endowed with speckled
coats, mimicking the sun-flecked forest
floor; this disruptive coloration, coupled
with absence of scent and their
instinctive &ldquo;freezing&rdquo; behavior, makes it
difficult for predators to detect them.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The whitetail deer not only uses its white
&ldquo;flag&rdquo; to warn others in the herd of
danger; it also allows a pursuing predator
to use it as a target. When the tail is
suddenly dropped&mdash;abruptly obliterating
the bright white patch&mdash;the deer seems to
disappear into its dim surroundings.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Since overly conspicuous animals are
prone to predation, natural selection favors

<p class="pcap">For such ground-dwelling birds as the white-tailed
ptarmigan, camouflage is an important survival adaptation.
The ptarmigan changes its plumage to match its
surroundings: it is white in winter, speckled in summer.
Moving slowly and refraining from flight, it is less
likely than more-active birds to be detected by sharp-eyed,
motion-conscious predators.</p>

<p class="pcap">Birds that when hatched are covered with down and
are able to move about freely are called <i>precocial</i>.
They are less dependent upon their parents than are
<i>altricial</i> young, which are naked and helpless when
they hatch; but they must rely heavily on a resemblance
to their surroundings for survival during their
first flightless weeks. This spruce grouse chick, which
blends into its sunflecked forest-floor habitat, is an
example of a precocial bird.</p>

<p class="pcap">The bold disruptive pattern of the killdeer chick&rsquo;s
plumage helps this precocial bird avoid detection in
its open-prairie environment. This adaptation, coupled
with the chick&rsquo;s instinct to freeze at the approach of
danger, ensures that enough young will survive to
perpetuate the species.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b><i id="f2fig5">Ursus arctos horribilus</i>: The Vulnerable King</b></p>
<p class="pcapc">At the apex of the food pyramid, this great
beast is unquestionably the king of
Glacier&rsquo;s biotic community. Yet the long-range
future of the grizzly bear is uncertain.
With the grizzly exterminated from
most of its former range&mdash;which once
extended into the midcontinent and south
into Mexico&mdash;its numbers have dwindled
in proportion to its diminished range.
Present concentrations in the contiguous
United States remain in and around
Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks.
Probably fewer than 200 of these magnificent
creatures live in Glacier National
Park.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Grizzlies are easily distinguished from
the more common black bear. In
addition to larger size and heavier build,
grizzlies have a characteristic shoulder
hump; long, conspicuous claws; and a
broad, concave face that gives them
a &ldquo;dished-in&rdquo; appearance. Fur is usually
brown; like the fur of the black bear,
however, color may range from black
to yellowish. Light tipped hairs make the
fur appear frosted, giving rise to the
nickname, &ldquo;silvertip.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pcapc">Grizzlies, popularly considered arch
predators, are more accurately described
as omnivores. Carrion, grasses, cow
parsnip, and several species of berries,
bulbs, and tubers make up a grizzly&rsquo;s diet,
along with insects, small mammals, and
an occasional ungulate that it can catch.
As a result, grizzlies play several roles in
the biotic community, functioning as
herbivore, scavenger, and predator.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Ranging widely in all life zones, grizzlies
follow the spring snowmelt up to the
alpine meadows, returning to lower elevations
to hibernate from November until
April. One to three cubs are born in
midwinter during hibernation. Since the
maternal bond lasts two years, a sow will
accept a mate only every other year.
Mortality of subadults is high, resulting
principally from competition among the
bears themselves. As with most animals,
range&mdash;habitat&mdash;appears to be the
limiting factor of grizzly populations.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The grizzly is normally shy and fearful
of man&mdash;but highly unpredictable.
Wounded or sick bears, sows defending
cubs, young adults, and bears that
have become conditioned to human
scent are the most dangerous. As
humans continue to encroach on grizzly
territory, odds of confrontation also
increase. Recent fatalities and personal
injuries inflicted by grizzlies pose a
vexing problem to the National Park
Service, which is charged with visitor
safety on the one hand and protection
of the park&rsquo;s remaining grizzly
population on the other. Continuing
study of grizzly ecology and increasingly
enlightened bear management programs
will, it is hoped, allow man and bear
to co-exist in a wilderness both require.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b><a id="f2fig6">Bald Eagles and Kokanee Salmon: A Recent Gathering</a></b></p>
<p class="pcapc">In 1916 the kokanee salmon, a small,
land-locked form of the Pacific coast
species, was planted in the Flathead
drainage. With the first planting augmented
by additional stockings, the fish
thrived in cold, deep Flathead Lake, and,
to a lesser extent, in Lake McDonald.
The salmon fed almost exclusively on
zooplankton.</p>
<p class="pcapc">By the mid-1930s, salmon runs were
becoming established. The outlet of Lake
McDonald provides an ideal spawning site
for the salmon. The fast-flowing water is
clear, cold, and shallow, and the creek
bed is gravelly.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Averaging 0.3 meters in length and weighing
less than a half-kilo, the 4-year-old
adult salmon cease feeding and begin to
migrate. Many thousands swim the 100
kilometers from Flathead Lake to
McDonald Creek. Males appear in the
creek first, arriving in late September, and
are soon followed by the females.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Using her tail to dig a redd (a shallow
nest depression), the female deposits
about 650 eggs. After fertilization by the
male, the eggs are covered over. The
adults die within three weeks after spawning,
their bodies exhausted from the
rigorous migration journey and the weeks-long
lack of sustenance.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Egg fatalities are high, due to stream
erosion and disturbance by other spawning
salmon. Hatching in late March, the
fry work their way out of the gravel and
migrate downstream.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Attracted to the 75,000-150,000 salmon
concentrated in a 3-kilometer stretch of
shallow water, bald eagles begin gathering
at McDonald Creek in October. It is not
known where the eagles come from or
where they go after the spawning run.
Glacier has fewer than 20 summer-resident
bald eagles, and these are distributed
among the remote lakes of the North
Fork area.</p>
<p class="pcapc">In 1939, 37 bald eagles were counted
along the creek. By 1969, 373 were reported,
representing approximately 10
percent of that year&rsquo;s estimated winter
population for the contiguous United
States. Since 1960, the count has averaged
240 birds. (In 1977 there were 444.)</p>
<p class="pcapc">Eagles feed by swooping down to pluck
salmon from the water or by wading out
to grab a fish stranded on a shallow
riffle. An eagle may consume as many as
six fish a day. Immature birds are not as
adept at catching fish and may harry
adults or other immatures into releasing
their catch.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b><a id="f2fig7">A Triumph of Many Colors</a></b></p>
<p class="pcapc">Grassland, meadow, tundra, or any other
area in Glacier suitable for plant growth
and supplied with abundant sunlight
produces an extravagance of wildflowers.
This display of various shapes and colors
is neither an accident nor a mere decoration
of nature. Nor would Earth&rsquo;s
recent explosion of mammal and bird
species have been possible without the
evolution of flowering plants.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Two hundred million years ago, early
in the Age of Reptiles, angiosperms
(flowering plants) had not yet evolved.
Plant reproduction still relied on spores
and cones. Then, during the Cretaceous
Period, the last sediments were being laid
down in the inland sea that covered most
of Montana. (It was these sediments that
the ancient Precambrian rocks of Glacier&rsquo;s
mountains later overrode, forming the
Lewis Overthrust.) During this period
the evolutionary miracle occurred:
flowering plants&mdash;grasses, vines, shrubs,
broadleaf trees, wildflowers&mdash;inherited
the Earth.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The timing was important. As Earth&rsquo;s
tropical climate gradually changed to
temperate extremes during this period,
the domination of cold-blooded dinosaurs
ended and the moisture-demanding
coniferous forests that had covered the
earth in green monotony began to shrink.
Angiosperms provided a solution to the
ecological void: grasses and forbs grew
where trees no longer could. Most important,
relationships evolved between this
new class of plants and the relatively
few species of insects then existing.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Insects began to use the pollen of flowering
plants; the angiosperms, in turn,
evolved bright petals and nectar that
exploited visiting insects for the plants&rsquo;
own reproductive purposes. This partnership
allowed insects to diversify rapidly,
evolving new, specialized forms such as
bees, moths, and butterflies. As a result,
predatory forms of insects and arachnids
also rapidly diversified.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The most dramatic change, however,
involved warm-blooded birds and
mammals, whose high rates of metabolism
required high-energy fuels. Unlike
gymnosperm seeds, which contain no
protective covering, angiosperm seeds are
surrounded by a fruit. The development
of these highly nutritious seeds, and
the attendant explosion of insect
species, ensured survival of the newly
evolved birds.</p>
<p class="pcapc">As birds diversified into seed-eaters,
insectivores, and carnivores, mammals,
then uncertain little ratlike creatures
darting among the feet of dinosaurs,
began a rapid rise to dominance;
grasslands promoted an explosion of
herbivorous and carnivorous species.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The evolution of angiosperms, and the
animal revolution it made possible, came
with amazing speed. Most significant, it
was a vital first step upon which the
meteoric rise of man depended.</p>

<p>Sudden hammering made me jump.
Above the forest darkness, a pileated woodpecker
leaned out from a high larch snag,
braced against the trunk by its specialized,
stiff tail feathers. This was the first time I
had seen this big white-and-black bird, the
&ldquo;cock-of-the-woods.&rdquo; There was ample evidence
of his work: the deep, oblong excavations
in the trunk and the pile of large wood
chips at its base, both characteristic of this
species. Again he hammered, and I could
see the chips falling. After a little edge-work
around the hole, he extracted a grub
and flew off, yammering against the advancing
dark.</p>
<p>Near a stream I stopped to sit down,
to listen to the water and maybe catch sight
of some small animal. Across the narrow
defile, from a slope dense with young hemlock,
came the buzzing note of a varied
thrush. Several notes followed, all on a
different pitch, all drawn out, level and
clear; the quality was pure but songless, disjointed,
deliberate, like someone testing the
reed of a strange woodwind. There seemed
no gladness in the heart of this thrush. The
song was dark, haunting, lonely.</p>
<p>On the trail ahead I could make out a
bird hopping rapidly along. After passing
the spot I could hear its song. There
couldn&rsquo;t be a hundred meters between
us, yet it seemed to be coming from a
great distance. I listened for as long as it
would sing. I tried to hear it for what it was,
a male Swainson&rsquo;s thrush proclaiming its
territory. But the ethereal, flute-like phrases
seemed an evensong made not for man&rsquo;s
ears but only for the forest itself.</p>
<p>I hurried on after the bird had ceased.
It was getting dark beneath the trees, but I
was beginning to be aware of creatures
underfoot, the mad dartings of shrew and
vole, more imagined than seen. When a deer
mouse jumped away I got out my flashlight.
Soon the beam caught a woodrat sitting atop
a fallen log. The light didn&rsquo;t bother him
in the least; as I approached, he picked up
his bushy tail in his forepaws. Whiskers
twitching, he looked more caricature than
real. Then he bounded off the log with
graceful, arching hops, and disappeared into
the night.</p>
<p>Against a patch of sky that appeared in
a clearing, I could make out bats, circling
and dipping like swallows. Locating a
hovering moth, I kept the light beam on it
until it vanished into a furry streak of
silence. It was time to head back.</p>
<p>By now it had become utterly dark
within the trees, a moonless, sightless, alien
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
world, given over to the marble-black eyes
of the small night mammals and the creatures
that hunt them. I thought of the
strange, unseen societies of the flying
squirrels, the nocturnal counterparts of red
squirrels; of the great-horned owls, inspecting
the same ground the goshawks scanned
during the day. Perhaps a foraging red fox
moved through the darkness nearby, or a
coyote on night patrol.</p>
<p>The flashlight beam probed ahead along
the trail. The exposed roots were given unnatural
shading and they seemed to thicken
and squirm as I approached. On either side
the tree trunks appeared to step backward
from the dim glow of the light. I felt lost
in this night, thinking of the great darkness
in all the timbered ridges that ran westward
from the Divide. In this vast cathedral
of crowded tree and peak, night was stood on
end, the stars shrunken to a circle overhead,
as if seen from the bottom of a well.
Mouselike, shivering, insignificant in this
wilderness, I scurried back to find a fire
and fill my empty senses with its heat and
snap and light, holding off the fright of
night and thinking of tomorrow&rsquo;s sun.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Scrub-Forest</h3>
<p>The crowning beauty of Glacier&mdash;the high,
cirqueheld meadows that scent the wind with
wildflower and waterfall&mdash;belongs to the
zone of scrub-forest.</p>
<p>At Logan Pass you are introduced to
the highlands. Here an exquisite upland
basin holds the Hanging Gardens, a wildflower-clothed
gradient laced with stair-step
bogs and lines of wind-bent subalpine fir. In
the dawn sun, before the first engine noise, it
shines unbroken, dewbright and sagging like
a spider web secured to the circle of surrounding
peaks.</p>
<p>This is the region the hiker remembers
best. The tall mountains wear this zone close
to the cliffs, and the trails encounter it
near the passes or follow it for long, level
stretches, as along the Garden Wall. I
remember Preston Park and Fifty Mountain,
the fire-touched bench of Granite
Park and the first sight of Sperry chalet,
built on a brow of rock at the upper reach
of trees. But most of all I remember the
terrible waterfall that becomes Bowman
Creek, the plunge of nearly a kilometer
that drains the magnificent upland bench
called Hole-in-the-Wall.</p>
<h4>Hole-in-the-Wall</h4>
<p>September. The season is growing late, the
meadow-rue dying and the leaves of the
wild strawberry failing at last. Everywhere
the red contagion of autumn surrounds the
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
vital green. The lower valleys have lost the
whistle of ground squirrels. They sun themselves
no longer these late, mild days. Ripe,
sluggish, and hawk-vulnerable, they sensed
the need of hibernation.</p>
<p>It has been eight years since I last
visited Hole-in-the-Wall, but I retain its
dimensions and hear its dozen waterfalls
at will. Once you have seen this basin you
have a measure by which to judge the high
country and a thirst for the meadows at
tree-line.</p>
<p>In Glacier, treelimit ranges between
1,850 and 2,300 meters, depending on local
conditions. The upper limit of tree growth&mdash;rarely
an even, horizontal line&mdash;is generally
an indistinct band running erratically across
a mountain&rsquo;s face: a tension zone reflecting
variations in wind and sun exposure, degree
of slope, snowpack accumulations, and the
presence of adequate soil and water.</p>
<p>Subalpine fir, whitebark pine, and Engelmann
spruce do not relinquish easily their
upward climb; where conditions become
severe, their growth is retarded and their
stature dwarfed. Deformed and pruned by
wind, their leaders winter-killed when they
outreach the protection of the winter snowpack,
trees become shrubs, forced to hug
the ground. Size belies age in these elfin
forests, or krummholz, where the growing
season is painfully brief and progress is
always uncertain. A twisted, gnarled little
bush, more snag than live branch, bearing
a single cone or two, may be senior by a
century to the giants of its race in the valley
below, which yearly shower the ground
with an abundant crop of cones.</p>
<p>This time I will come from Goathaunt,
passing Lakes Janet and Francis, reaching
Brown Pass from the east, and camp in
the spectacular garden between Brown and
Boulder Passes.</p>
<p>Meadows and rock slides break the
forest as the trail gains elevation and distance
through the valley. The spruce and fir thin
out rapidly at the valley head, the trail
climbing the grassy slope to low, broad
Brown Pass. Below the pass is Thunderbird
Pond, which receives the meltwater from
a glacier high on a shelf of Thunderbird
Mountain and is bordered by a low jungle
of willow. In the water stands a bull moose,
its heavy, fully formed antlers ready for the
season&rsquo;s impending business.</p>
<p>I was hoping again to see Cassin&rsquo;s
finches and Audubon&rsquo;s warblers on the pass;
but the fir grove is quiet. Sitting down to
rest and listen, I become aware of a strange
silence. No birds sing or flit among the
trees, no alarms pass back and forth among
alert ground squirrels. There is no wind&mdash;an
odd condition for the Continental Divide.
This place seems to be holding its breath.
High overhead, a veil of cirrus cloud arranges
long spears across the sky.</p>
<p>Moving off the pass, along the dome of
Mt. Chapman, I experience anew the old excitement
of this high country. Abruptly the
gorge of Bowman valley opens up, revealing
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
the twisting blue snake of Bowman Lake
far down the narrow, cliff-imprisoned valley.
Here again are the northern titans&mdash;Numa,
Peabody, Boulder, Thunderbird, and Rainbow;
and Carter, with its high glacier
baring blue ice teeth to the sun.</p>
<p>It is not the climb that makes your
heart pound now; the trail is suddenly narrow
and cliff-defiant, cut by the plunging
waters of snowbanks far above. These are
splendid peaks, unmatched in a land of
muscled, brutal earth. Even the air seems
to retain the scent of glacier work.</p>
<p>At last the view of Hole-in-the-Wall, a
staircase cirque excavated between the gigantic
spread ribs of Mt. Custer. The slopes
of beargrass are seed-spotted and gaunt
now, the white fullness gone. Western pasqueflowers
have accomplished their magic
transformation; known in this season as old
man&rsquo;s beard, they nod their tufts of grizzled
seedhead silk in the wind. Red and yellow
monkeyflowers bloom yet, crowding along
the many stream courses, and waterloving
sedges and mosses surround pools of collected
water on the broad horseshoe tiers.</p>
<p>A spur trail drops down into the campground
on the last ledge. Through a cleft in
its lip plummets the gathered water of the
basin. From the valley below, the waterfall
appears to be springing from a hole in the
headwall, giving this basin its name. Down,
down, down, roars the water where once a
mighty glacier ground its teeth.</p>
<p>I leave until later the making of camp;
by now the sharp shadows of Boulder
Peak stab the valley forest and are beginning
the upward assault of Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Around the basin headwalls, last winter&rsquo;s
snowbanks remain formidable. Snow
caves send out meltwater torrents. Glacier
lilies and patches of spring beauty line their
fringes. Pasqueflowers bloom in pockets.
Here, among the asters of August, bloom
also the first flowers of spring, shooting up
as the snowbanks shrink, making these spots
of snow-free ground a patchwork of May
and July, August and June. The shrubs that
line the furious water are willows, still bud-swollen
this tenth day of September. The
coming days will bring a sharp surprise.</p>
<p>Winter will soon stop the melting of this
snow. Could it be that I am seeing the first
year of a reawakening ice age? If so, each
year the snowfields would grow thicker and
broader, connecting the shelves into one ice
mass again, lilies and willows entombed, the
summer heat failing to rescue them, until the
ice at last began to slide, stripping the soil
and once more plucking at living rock.</p>
<p>Then these dwarfed fir, which cling
precariously to the cliffs and hide behind the
backs of boulders, would be in more danger
than they were from their recent antagonists.
Engulfed by ice, they would know the shearing
wind no more. Their skeletons would
rain down into the valley below, signalling
another long forest retreat. But they have
waited out the mountain ice before and
would send their seeds again to this valley,
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
changed however it might be, as they have
always done.</p>
<p>Evening brings out two sleek mule deer
does. As they graze, their large ears stand
erect, sorting out the lesser sounds from
the ceaseless roar of water. Both raise
their heads and point their ears, statue
straight, at the scuttle of a porcupine. A
noise among the rocks draws a backward
glance and focus of those ears. I would
like the sensitivity of such fine equipment, to
hear what deer have always heard.</p>
<p>Setting about the business of camp, I
wonder about those animals that watched
me for a while, then moved off, having
seen a tent go up before. With the appearance
of the moon the wind increases and
they test the air more often now. Do they
have visions of cougar or grizzly with every
snap the wind delivers?</p>
<p>In summer these high meadows see a
surprising variety of animal life. Briefly
out of hibernation are marmots and the
handsome golden-mantled ground squirrels.
Mice, voles, shrews, and woodrats run
among the shadows, feeding on the season&rsquo;s
feast of seeds and insects. A nightmare
for these are the fierce little weasels that
haunt the rocks.</p>
<p>Tracks of cougar and wolverine are
sometimes seen, often teasingly fresh; to
glimpse either of these elusive predators is
to taste the finest wine of wilderness.</p>
<p>Before the berry season, grizzlies grub
the meadows for the tasty bulbs of glacier
lilies and the tubers of spring beauty; often
distracted by the scent of a ground squirrel
in its burrow, they sometimes make a huge
excavation for a small reward.</p>
<p>White-crowned sparrows sing in July
from the low tops of the battered trees,
though their nests are on the ground below.
Grey-crowned rosy finches patrol the drier
ground for seeds while water pipits hunt
insects in the wet areas. High above, a
golden eagle scans the basin again, circling
slowly before following a ridge south to
sight another likely slope in its 10,000-hectare
territory.</p>
<p>The moon shines through the tent top.
The wind, blowing more violently now,
shivers the nylon and interrupts the voice of
the waterfall. I have followed the pasqueflower
run from the April prairies here to
its highest bloom near treeline. I think about
the triangular seed pods of the glacier lilies,
colonies of steep-throated blue gentians, and
the season&rsquo;s last glory of goldenrod. Indian
paintbrush, from white to fire red, blazes the
slopes that light the fringes of sleep.</p>
<p>I awake to a determined rain, the moon
gone and the tent shuddering with wind-blast.
I try not to think of the steel-cold air,
and slip into a fitful sleep that seems an
endless treadmill of rocky trail.</p>
<p>Stiff and unrefreshed, I look out into
the dawnless morning. The tip of Thunderbird
is detached from its base by grey clouds
swirling at its throat. A wave of sleet slants
down, dancing on the rocks, chanting triumph
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
over the buried, bent, and broken
flowers of yesterday.</p>
<p>So I must make my escape, short of
Boulder Pass. Unattainable now, invisible
above the cirque, that high pass grows in
my memory. This testament to what a
glacier can do, to the struggle of trees and
the life-pioneers that invade such harsh
places, is at my feet but shrouded with
snow. My hands grow stiff and numb in the
blunt work of packing up.</p>
<p>I had wished to see Kinnerly Peak again,
rising from the western Kintla valley,
and walk along black ledges of the lava that
floors the pass. Beyond it grows a grove of
subalpine larch, stately, seldom encountered,
the least common tree species in Glacier.
Confined to this narrow zone between forest
and alpine, it reaches up tall and proud,
impervious to the gruelling climate that
makes cowering shrubs of other trees.</p>
<p>But all must wait another year, for this
season comes down hard. And the will of
winter is to erase whatever summer had
devised.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Tundra</h3>
<p>Porcelain-cold, the November sun dawns
in the southeast sky. The ledges, ice-encrusted,
layered with sleet from a recent
squall, whistle the cold morning wind aside.
Rattling down, a slide of rock plunges off the
final ledge, seconds passing before the hollow
sounds of impact clatter back. Like an
apparition of winter itself, white beard bent
sideways by the wind, a mountain goat
steps to the precipice edge. Looking out
across the vast white void, its long belly
hair and pantaloons streaming with the
ceaseless wind, this strange animal, product
of some unfathomable ingenuity, hesitates
but a moment; dropping down from step to
invisible step along the sheer rock face,
fracturing the ice glaze as it goes, it turns a
wall and disappears. A nimble, eight-months-old
kid follows.</p>
<p>Blinking and twisting in the dull light,
the shower of shattered ice clinks softly
downward against rock, fading away like
the short summers of this place.</p>
<p>But while the wind chants winter,
life has made a passage here, and also
waits, hidden in seed and root and den.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />The nanny and her kid have bedded down
now, looking across the deep, snowy basin
below. Their ledge shines with the first spear
of sunlight.</p>
<p>Far below the pass that connects Mount
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
Siyeh to the snow-giants Matahpi and Going-to-the-sun,
three male white-tailed ptarmigan
emerge from their night&rsquo;s huddle
within a snowbank and step out to peck at
an exposed mat of willow. Ptarmigan, the
only birds on the winter tundra, wear white
plumage in this season, helping to camouflage
them in the snow, just as their mottled
brown summer plumage makes them difficult
to detect among bare rocks. There are
few predators here to hunt them now, but
they move with habitual slowness; quick
movement can be fatal when summer brings
numerous eyes to scan the slopes. With legs
and feet heavily feathered and sharp claws
to scratch for food beneath the snow, the
ptarmigan live at truce with winter. When
blizzards rage between the peaks, they nestle
together in snow dens, beyond the reach of
the winds. Ptarmigan hens winter lower in
taller willow thickets, but the males prefer
to take their winter as high as possible.</p>
<p>Now they crouch behind the wind-deflecting
rocks, dozing in the meager warmth
of the morning sun.</p>
<p>Near the snowless summit crags, a flash
of brown fur zigzags among the rocks. That
would be a pika. Only for a moment does
it show itself, so quickly does it move.</p>
<p>Also called the rock rabbit, the diminutive
pika belongs to the order of hares and
rabbits. Resembling a small guinea pig, this
sturdy creature spurns hibernation as a way
to beat the challenge of winter. Instead, it
spends the summer laying in a store of hay
for the lean season, spreading cut grass to
cure upon the rocks and tending its &ldquo;haystacks,&rdquo;
on which its survival hangs.</p>
<p>Winter is a great peril to small mammals.
Their small bodies, because of a large
surface area in relation to volume, retain
heat poorly, and their high metabolic fires
consume calories quickly. Great amounts of
energy are required to sustain an active
animal in rough terrain, placing further
demands on the animal&rsquo;s capacity to survive
the cold. The pika may need to stack
as much as 25 kilos of hay; to keep its
furnace burning during winter it will have
to fuel its stomach almost hourly.</p>
<p>Small animals of cold climates often
show distinctive body adaptations. On the
pika the small, rounded ears lie flat along
the head, the tail is inconspicuous, the legs
are short; heat loss from exposed surfaces
is thus reduced. Fur insulates the soles of
the pika&rsquo;s feet while at the same time providing
good traction on steep rock faces.</p>
<p>Hidden below these rocks are the hibernating
marmots and the sleeping ground
squirrels. Beneath the snow the mice,
shrews, and pocket gophers struggle on with
their lives. But above ground, directly confronting
this arctic climate, are the pika,
the ptarmigan, and the mountain goat.</p>
<p>A triumph of adaptation, the mountain
goat faces the winter day without benefit of
either the pika&rsquo;s den or the ptarmigan&rsquo;s snow
roost.</p>
<p>The nanny and kid descend from their
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
ledge to search out browse at treeline with
other members of a loose band&mdash;yearlings,
young males, other nannies with kids. At
the fringes of the band a solitary adult billy
only grudgingly associates with other members
of his kind; for this is the season of rut.</p>
<p>Not really goats at all, these relatives of
the European mountaineering chamois are
insulated from the wind by coats of long,
hollow-haired fur overlying woolly underfur.
They are stocky, stiff-legged, and deliberate,
able to negotiate the walls and pinnacles
with their superbly adapted hoofs. The
unique design of these hoofs gives the animal
great traction and stability on precarious
crags. Opening towards the front, the
cleft between the two hoofs spreads each
outward as the animal descends a slope,
helping to grip the rocky surface. In addition,
the large, rough, and pliant sole of
each foot conforms to the bare rock, increasing
traction.</p>
<p>There is little need for the goat to leave
its steep sanctuaries; it can subsist on
lichens and mosses if browse is not available.
It depends on the inaccessibility of the
cliffs for its security. Accidents, avalanches,
and rockfall are greater enemies than predators.
Golden eagles sometimes attempt to
knock newborn kids from ledges and a
young goat quickly retreats under its nanny
when an eagle soars by. With the protection
of sharp spike horns and a terrifying terrain,
adult goats seldom fall victim to cougar
or grizzly.</p>
<p>It will be a long time before the snow
releases this land and wapiti, bighorn,
grizzly, and cougar wander back into these
high basins. In this winter minimum of life,
the spring songs of rosy finches, water pipits
and white-crowned sparrows seem an impossible
extravagance.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />I am drawn to the spring tundra&mdash;to the
vigor and tenacity of its sparse life&mdash;where
survival itself seems ceremony enough. But
it is a strange world, where a man is out of
perspective. Here the plant cover is carpet-high,
and distance, for the lack of trees,
tricks the eye. Here the wind, snow, and sun
quickly burn skin, and the intense light,
reflected from snowbanks, stabs at the eyes.
Almost instantly, a sandwich is sucked dry
of its moisture. The desiccating wind probes
the ears until it seems at last to pierce your
brain. Except for fearful mountain walls the
only shadow is your own. Animals seem
somehow remote and unknowable, as if seen
through glass. A day on the tundra and you
feel the want of a company of trees.</p>
<p>Yet once exposed, you acquire a craving
for the look of tundra. Nowhere else is
there such an impatience for spring&mdash;the
flowers rush into bloom; the male water
pipit soars, its skylark song crystal sharp in
the thin air. The nesting birds are restless,
for sun-days and warm days are few, precious,
and quickly spent. Insects and spiders
abound&mdash;flying about the peaks or crawling
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
among the rocks.</p>
<p>Summer brings bands of bighorn rams
up from the valley to explore the highest
meadows. Though not so sure-footed as the
goats, they too have hoofs adapted to climbing
steep faces, and they walk the slopes
not far below the goats.</p>
<p>Marmots, which whistle sharply when
threatened, spend their days sunbathing and
grazing; they must fill out their now loose-hanging
fur coats with life-sustaining fat for
the coming winter.</p>
<p>Alpine animals are blessed with mobility
and can choose their weathers, retreating
to burrow, den, or rock-harbor to escape the
worst fury of storms. But what about the
plants, rooted forever in one spot, assaulted
by an untempered sun and a drying wind,
and facing the almost daily threat of freeze
and storm?</p>
<p>Alpine plants, through their design and
growing habits, have adapted themselves to
the rigorous demands of this climate in
many ways. Most plants are perennial: there
just aren&rsquo;t enough days or nutrients available
for the growing of entire plants each year
from seed. And they have the ability to
grow and carry on photosynthesis at temperatures
just above freezing, thus extending
their season. In this zone, temperatures are
rarely above 15&deg; C; the mean summer temperature
is about 10&deg; C. But a flower such
as the alpine buttercup, which is found at
treeline or above, can grow through several
centimeters of snow; heat given off during
the plant&rsquo;s respiration will create an opening
through which it can emerge.</p>
<p>Plants have various adaptations to meet
the demands of the alpine environment.
Yellow stonecrop, not restricted to this zone,
is nevertheless able to survive here because
of its fleshy succulence and a waxy covering
that prevents water loss. On some plants,
protective hairs covering leaves and stems
help retard the burning effects of wind and
sun. Often this pubescent foliage looks more
grey than green, for the soft hairs mute the
color.</p>
<p>Cushion growth is another alpine adaptation.
The moss campion cushion, covered
with delicate pink flowers, grows to about
one-third of a meter across and only 3
to 5 centimeters high. Spreading out close
to the ground, the plant avoids the major
violence of the wind and hoards moisture
like a sponge.</p>
<p>The dryad, growing abundantly on the
windy sweep of Siyeh Pass, shows alpine
adaptations in several ways. The energy of
the mature plant is channeled primarily into
reproduction: its large flower, supported by
a short stem, matures quickly; and it produces
many seeds, ensuring germination of a
few. An evergreen, it begins to synthesize
water and carbon dioxide into food as soon
as the snow is gone; and its rolled leaves prevent
rapid evaporation. It grows as a low and
woody mat that year by year extends itself
through the production of new shoots that
carpet the rock. Mat growth has the advantage
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
of retaining dead plant material and
capturing wind-blown grains of soil, allowing
the plant slowly to enlarge its soil base.</p>
<p>Compared to the forest, the heartbeat
of the tundra is painfully slow. Here a plant
may grow for a quarter of a century before
it has acquired the reserves necessary for
flowering. Contrasted with the progress on
the tundra, forest succession races by with
dizzying speed. Yet imperceptible as the
change may be the alpine plant community
also passes from pioneer to climax.</p>
<p>Beyond the limit of other plants, lichens
thrive, encrusting rocks with their rainbow
colors. A lichen is actually a primitive and
highly successful association between a
fungus and an alga, working together for
mutual benefit. The fungus protects the
delicate alga, trapping and holding moisture;
the green alga, in turn, produces enough
food to sustain the needs of the fungus.</p>
<p>Generating rock-disintegrating acids
that help secure this partnership to the rock,
lichens, along with physical weathering,
help break down the rocks into soil particles.
Collected in pockets by run-off or
wind, rudimentary soil is slowly invaded by
cushion plants. After centuries of colonization
by these, while the meager soil is deepened
and enriched and moisture retention is
increased, other plants move in, climaxing
at last in hardy grasses and sedges. As in the
forest, pioneer species change the environment
to their detriment, creating a habitat
better suited to other species.</p>
<p>Although it will progress with geologic
slowness, the rocky ground of Siyeh Pass&mdash;its
plant cover presently scant and wind-rowed
by frost-heave and relentless wind&mdash;will
in time develop grasses and sedges, the
climax vegetation of the alpine meadows.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />Simplicity rules the alpine zone. Here life is
reduced to bare essentials. Chief controlling
force is climate; but the plants and animals
that live here are well adapted. Compared
to the lower realms, where both
competition and predation are fierce, life
here looks secure.</p>
<p>There is a penalty to simplicity. In the
lowland, the long food chains and diversity
of species, the long growing season, and the
abundant food supply give the forest an
adjustment mechanism and healing power
not found on the critically balanced tundra.
The greater the variety in a plant and animal
community, the greater the stability. So
in the alpine world there exists a paradox: the
most durable life forms constitute the most
fragile community.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h3 id="c11">The Water Communities</h3>
<p>Snowfields begin again their summer-long
melt. The alpine stream, vocal again, collects
its water from a thousand places. Miniature
gorges drain the meadow, gurgling
with the sparkle and rush of meltwater in
the lengthening spring days.</p>
<p>Gathering volume, the stream seems to
hurry faster; at the first rock staircase, it
begins to sing. I follow the gully downward,
drawn like the water. There is excitement
in the growing dash and roar, a wind-gust
sweeping spray into the air. A rainbow appears,
holding steady to the swirling cloud
of spray, then doubles and abruptly disappears.</p>
<p>At the first great plunge the water
lunges outward over the lip. Like glass at
shattering, long shards lance out. But the
wind feathers the sharp edges as they fall.</p>
<p>The close thunder of a waterfall beats
at your head, and your mind must shout to
think. Here is water, a most amazing and
most important substance. Perhaps some
of this same water was once part of the
ancient sea in which was laid down the mudstone
of this ledge; was once drunk by
dinosaurs; has coursed the globe countless
times; and has flowed in this very stream
before. In solid, liquid, or gaseous form,
it goes through its own cycle. Together with
sunlight, water makes possible and maintains
all life on Earth.</p>
<h4>Ouzel Music</h4>
<p>A glacier might cling to a winter snow a
hundred years and turn it to ice, a blue
tool to rasp and pluck at rocks, before
letting it go. Lingering summer snowfields
might delay its passage for a time. But the
water always wins at last, becoming, in one
decisive instant, liquid again, and beginning
its long journey to the sea. Plants and dry
air will intercept some of its molecules, sending
them back into the atmosphere to bloom
as fog and cloud; but as rain, snow, or dew,
these are soon commissioned to the land
again.</p>
<p>Water is so familiar to us that we
seldom think about it. We know that fish
swim in the lower lakes, and we are vaguely
aware of the bewildering assortment of life-forms
abounding in a pond. But life begins
in the streams.</p>
<p>Even cups of cold meltwaters, scooped
out of a rivulet only a few meters away from
its snowbank source, contain some life.
Snow algae, which grow on the snowbank
surface, often sufficiently dense to give the
snow a distinctive red complexion, are released
into the meltwater. In summer, small
invertebrate life can be discovered in the
standing pools of even the highest cirque.</p>
<p>But conditions are not good for the
development of complete aquatic food
chains in the streams and lakes of higher
elevations. Alpine lakes, or tarns, support
little visible life. Often flanked by high
ridges and peaks, many tarns receive scant
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
direct sunlight during the day. Since these
lakes occupy basins that capture tremendous
amounts of snowfall, the snowbanks persist
in the mountain shadows, and summer
makes little progress in warming the water.
Iceberg Lake, for example, is seldom free
of floating ice, and its temperature never
rises above 4&deg; C in summer, even at the
surface.</p>
<p>Moving out of the cirque lakes, water is
soon churning again, dashing downward
many hundreds of meters to the valleys
below, in rapids, cascades, and breathless
waterfalls. Not surprisingly, few plants and
animals are adapted to life in fast-moving
water.</p>
<p>Algae can be found covering streambed
rocks and stranded, water-polished tree
trunks. Securely attached by holdfasts, these
small plant forms survive the rigorous
stream flow that would destroy the larger
vascular plants. Several species exist, from
microscopic forms to branched filamentous
algae whose long hairlike strands wave in
the current.</p>
<p>A surprising number of insects live on
the stream bottom, finding a measure of
protection from the current in the jumble
of rocks. Underwater beetles live under the
gravel or among the debris at the stream-edge,
or cling to stones and sticks. Scurrying
and creeping among the rock-crannies
are the larvae of stoneflies, mayflies, and
caddisflies. These and the small fish that
venture up from lower lakes are the food
of the water ouzel, a creature that loves the
places where the waters thunder.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />The noise of the water is overpowering. A
slip into this boiling rage would mean quick
death. Looking 10 meters across the dim,
mist-slippery, water-scoured canyon, I see a
young water ouzel peering out of its unique
nest, on the lookout for its parents. Clouds
of spray keep the nest of living moss continually
wet; but this bird is waterproofed
with an oily plumage and keeps its vigil
at the nest opening. Peering into the torrent
below, then upstream and downstream, it
awaits patiently the delivery of the next
meal.</p>
<p>With the approach of one of the adults,
three other heads crowd the opening, begging
yellow mouths agape. Flying low, the
ouzel parent zeros through the heavy spray,
alighting on a slippery boulder below the
nest ledge. Preparing to fly up to the nest
with its load of insect larvae, the ouzel
spots me across the water. At its sharp
<i>jigic, jigic</i> alarm, the bills of the young
snap instantly shut. Nervously the bird regards
my close presence, dipping its entire
body rapidly up and down, as if keeping
time with the surging torrent.</p>
<p>Discovering no danger, the dusky blue-grey
bird bobs more slowly. The other adult,
returning from an upstream forage, alights
on the same rock, occasioning a new outcry
from the fledglings. Each in turn, the parent
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
birds fly up to feed their young, beating
their wings to maintain their position at the
perchless nest. Not pausing to regard me
further, they split the stream between them
again, one flying upstream and one down, to
continue the hunt. Blinking and shaking
the collected mist from its bill, the single
young sentry renews its watch.</p>
<h4>In Shallow Waters</h4>
<p>Life abounds in the shallow lakes and ponds.
Calm, protected John&rsquo;s Lake offers a
fine example of how a complex aquatic
plant-and-animal community can exist in
balance in a confined space. The water
teems with the microscopic algae, protozoans,
and rotifers that sustain the barely
visible zooplankton. Dancing, flitting, hopping,
and swaying through the water, these
zooplankton in turn support the larger
plankton-eating animals.</p>
<p>Dragonflies and damselflies shoot past,
crackling their wings, and perch in the bog
grass. Looking into the shallow water, you
will see a wealth of small animal life. A
spotted frog swims into view, floating to the
surface beside a lily pad so that its eyes
protrude above the water.</p>
<p>The ribbonlike form of a leech swims
across the bottom toward deeper water.
Looking closer, you see that the water
swarms with bizarre shapes&mdash;water boatmen
propelling themselves with oarlike
appendages, a gliding mayfly nymph, then
a predacious diving beetle surfacing, grasping
a bubble of air beneath its shiny brown
wing plates and disappearing downward
again&mdash;the bubble&rsquo;s edge shining silver&mdash;into
the brown bottom debris. Suddenly a
whirligig beetle sets the surface to spinning,
wrinkling the view below.</p>
<p>Everywhere in the water there is animal
life, forms that are attached, free-swimming,
crawling on the bottom, and clinging to or
swimming on the surface film. The gray,
slimy encrustation on a sunken log looks
like a covering of lichen but is really a
freshwater sponge, a colonial animal that
feeds by filtering minute plankton from the
water. Another attached creature is the
barely visible hydra; this twig-shaped predator,
related to marine jellyfish, captures
water fleas and other small animals in its
several poisonous tentacles.</p>
<p>Water beetles, backswimmers, water
boatmen, and many other creatures move
about more or less freely in the water, propelling
themselves along with jerky movements.
Suspended between surface and bottom
are the zooplankton, the tiny water
fleas, cyclops, daphnia, and others, which
feed by filtering minute algae. On the bottom
and below live scavenging worms.
Water striders skate on the surface film.</p>
<p>Along the shore, frogs, salamanders,
garter snakes, and water shrews are hunting.
Dabbling and diving ducks patrol about,
tipping or submerging for the bottom
plants. Moose tracks circle the muddy shore.
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
Because it produces vegetation abundantly,
John&rsquo;s Lake sustains a great diversity of
animal life.</p>
<h4>Beaver Ponds</h4>
<p>Fully 10 percent of all the present meadow
area in the Rocky Mountains is estimated
to have been created by beaver, the only
animal besides man that engineers extensive
changes in the environment to suit its own
needs.</p>
<p>When beavers dam a stream, they set
in motion another form of succession. If
the resulting backwater floods a forest area,
the trees are soon killed, creating a broad
opening in the forest canopy. Water-associated
plants and shrubs quickly invade the
pond and shoreline, creating favorable habitat
for waterfowl, moose, blackbirds, amphibians,
wading birds, warblers, marsh
hawks, and a score of other animals.</p>
<p>After many years the water becomes
shallow, filling in with silt and plant debris.
When the beavers abandon the site, the dam
may rupture for lack of maintenance and
the pond will rapidly drain. Or it may continue
to hold, delaying for several more
years its slow conversion to meadow. Stimulated
by the nutrient-rich mud, the water
grasses, sedges, and shrubs finally choke the
water with their accumulating debris, transforming
the area into a bog.</p>
<p>Gradually the ground firms as more
humus is created and more silt is trapped.
The area becomes meadow, supporting
grasses, sedges, and other flowering plants.
Trees begin to reinvade the drier ground,
and eventually the meadow reverts to
forest. Centuries may be required to see
this cycle through, from forest to pond, to
bog, to meadow, to forest again. At each
stage many of the animal inhabitants
change: the song of the western robin and
the chatter of a red squirrel in the original,
pre-beaver forest give way to the croak
of a heron; the heron is replaced by the
insect-and-berry-eating cedar waxwing; the
waxwing is followed by the tree-dwelling
western robin and red squirrel.</p>
<h4>Lakes Cold and Deep</h4>
<p>Seeming to skate on its own reflection, a
spotted sandpiper comes in low over the
quiet water, wingtips almost touching the
surface of the lake. It alights at the shore
and folds its wings. Amid the rounded
rocks, this plain but elegant little shorebird
is all but swallowed up. Teetering constantly
on long legs, it sets off along the water&rsquo;s
edge, pecking here and there, coming
closer and closer, never forgetting to stop
and curtsy, as if acknowledging, while
hurrying offstage, the applause of an
audience.</p>
<p>As it draws near, several water striders
skate away from the shore. A stonefly,
scuttling between two rocks, is deftly
speared. So large a morsel makes the bird
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
pause and rough its feathers, then scamper
into the water to take a drink. Teetering
again, it passes in front of me and continues
down the shore, where I soon lose sight of
it rounding a rocky point.</p>
<p>I am sitting at the foot of Lake McDonald,
watching the darkness gather over
the valley, seeing the last light slide upward
to the tips of the distant mountains. As
daylight dissolves, this long fleet of familiar
peaks seems almost to glide toward darkness,
slow and silent as sailing ships.</p>
<p>The sheet of motionless water stretches
many kilometers away between tree-covered
moraines. The water is deep and cold. No
emergent plants line the barren shore. It
would seem that no life, except for the
single gull that rests on the water far away,
exists in this nearly thousand-meter-high
lake.</p>
<p class="tb">&#9632;<br />Considering the great volume of Glacier&rsquo;s
large, deep lakes, the life they support is
indeed meager. A large part of the reason
lies with the nature of their shores, where
almost no plants grow. A combination of
factors prevents the development of a lush
shoreline growth.</p>
<p>Contoured like bathtubs, these steep-sided
lakes exhibit narrow or non-existent
shoreline shallows, which are vital for the
production of rooted plants. Strong wave
action and extensive seasonal fluctuations in
the level of these natural reservoirs prevent
the development of emergent water plants
in locations where they might otherwise
be expected.</p>
<p>Since sunlight cannot penetrate to the
bottom of these deep lakes, they are deprived
of bottom-anchored plants in midlake
as well. As a result, herbivorous animal life
must depend almost wholly on algal growth.
Wave action inhibits the spread of free-floating
algae by washing much of it onto
the shore. Deep lakes are also low in available
oxygen, preventing the development of
bottom decomposers, which would rapidly
release nutrients as they break down the
accumulating debris washed into the lake.
Without a steady supply of nutrients, plant
growth is retarded.</p>
<p>Since the food chain depends upon
green plants, the ability of a lake to support
higher animals such as fish depends upon its
ability first to produce adequate plant
growth. The production of one kilo of trout
requires that a lake produce about 1,000
kilos of plants to support 100 kilos of
herbivorous invertebrates, which are eaten
by 10 kilos of carnivorous insects, on which
the trout feed.</p>
<p>Compared to smaller shallow lakes,
which teem with visible life, cold, deep,
nutrient-poor lakes such as McDonald appear
to be watery deserts. Yet because of
their great volume&mdash;Lake McDonald contains
5 or 6 cubic kilometers of water&mdash;these
large lakes do sustain significant numbers
of fish. Of the 22 kinds of fishes found
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
within the park, most are coldwater species.
Trout, whitefish, grayling, suckers, minnows,
and carp fill the roles of herbivore, carnivore,
and scavenger. Agile, highly mobile, and
acutely sensitive, fish represent the most
successful total adaptation to the aquatic environment.</p>
<p>Through the stocking of nonnative
species, including plantings in formerly fish-free
lakes, the natural aquatic communities
of many of Glacier&rsquo;s lakes and streams have
been permanently modified.</p>
<p>Aquatic food chains are not confined
to the water. Ospreys, ducks, mergansers,
otter, mink, and many other semi-aquatic
or terrestrial birds and mammals utilize the
plants and animals of the water. In fall, a
remarkable spectacle occurs along the outlet
of Lake McDonald. Attracted to the kokanee
salmon concentrations, which run
from Flathead Lake to spawn and die in
these clear, shallow waters, bald eagles
collect to exploit the vulnerable fish. In
1977, 444 eagles were counted in one census.
This food resource is also exploited by
grizzlies, coyotes, skunks, gulls, loons, and
other animals. On occasion, even white-tail
deer have been observed swallowing
salmon!</p>

<p>This park is very special. The people who
know it well feel proprietary toward its
mountains, scattered lakes, and glaciers. Perhaps
it is the arrangement of the land, an
unsurpassed concentration of American
wilderness. Time and again I have thought,
as I regarded some aspect of this country,
<i>yes, this is exactly right</i>&mdash;almost, it would
seem, as if some magic existed that could
translate thought and emotion into rock and
bark.</p>
<p>Glacier remains largely unexploited,
bearing still the aspect of the Earth the
Indians knew for 500 generations&mdash;a land
where it is yet possible to feel a sense of
discovery, sense that a single man matters.
On too many mountains, man has tarnished
whatever he has touched; but here the land
has shed, as a fir sloughs snow, a long succession
of traders, trappers, explorers,
hunters, surveyors, prospectors, loggers,
settlers, and tourists.</p>
<p>You may walk the same trail a dozen
times and not tire of the view. I have given
up wondering why. I know only that these
are mountains a man might grow old with,
and that mountain-fever never diminishes
but only changes its look, as a forest does
over many years.</p>
<p>Repeatedly I have noticed that this park
creates an instant bond between strangers.
A certain pause intrudes at the first mention
of Glacier National Park, and a look of
distance comes, as Red Eagle becomes real
again, or the wind at Firebrand is remembered,
or the flowers of Fifty-Mountain
converge once more upon the senses.</p>
<p>Never are we quenched. If a goshawk
rushes past, straining upward with its
squirming load of ground squirrel, forever
afterward our blood demands more. The
sight of a wolverine running is not enough.
Nor the magnificent assemblage of bald
eagles feasting on November salmon. More
days of this: mountain goats leaping impossible
ledges, wave tracks from a beaver
reaching out on dawn water. There are
messages here, loud as kingfishers. The land
has languages, stories to tell.</p>
<p>But in wilderness there is no moral,
save that it must continue. For all our probings
and plottings we discover no adequate
interpretation of the forces we find swirling
about us. A larch you must touch to know;
your neck must feel the ache of too much
looking up. Watch its treepoint pirouette.
Then, looking back at the world level, you
will find that you have lost all answers. We
have learned the art of building bridges,
cataloging plants, predicting what a shrew
might do. Of the essential mystery, we know
nothing.</p>
<p>For nature assigns no &ldquo;roles&rdquo; to its
creatures; there is no &ldquo;reason&rdquo; for a forest
fire, which burns mightily but with no intent.
Life&rsquo;s only &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; is the feeding of
life, and the beauty we see therein is but
its lack of guarantee: for the chipmunk
and the weasel, and the man who measures
his life to theirs, no assurance of long days
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
and tempered seasons, abundant seeds,
ample meat. In wilderness there is mystery
yet, unsimplified, not reduced, resplendent
and immense.</p>
<p>Whatever the conclusion of this planet,
however many the acts to follow in this
consuming drama&mdash;mountains coming up,
mountains going down, forests, lakes, and
seas skimming past like wind-driven scud
clouds before a storm&mdash;at least in the scant
shadow of this present age there is an
achievement of sorts. For now, with this
creature man, such things as mountains can
be loved. And men have memories to fill.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will look for shooting
stars&mdash;purple spring flowers that point their
fire down, always down toward the center of
the Earth, as if to give in their brief term
beneath the sun a tribute to this most excellent
mystery.</p>
<p>Today I can say nothing more, neck-sore
now from looking at larchtops swaying
with the wind of this splendid morning.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
